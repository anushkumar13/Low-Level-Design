# üî® Structural Design Patterns

## What Are Structural Design Patterns?

Structural design patterns focus on the **composition of classes or objects**. Their goal is to form **larger structures efficiently** while ensuring the system remains **flexible, maintainable, and scalable**.

They define **how classes and objects interact**, how they are **composed**, and how they work together to provide **new functionality**.

### üß± Real-Life Analogy: LEGO Blocks

Each LEGO block = one object.
Structural design patterns = the **rules or techniques** used to combine these blocks into a **large structure** ‚Äî without changing the individual blocks themselves.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è List of Common Structural Patterns

| Pattern Name  | Description (in simple terms)                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adapter**   | Makes one object compatible with another system (like a charger adapter üîå).                |
| **Bridge**    | Separates abstraction from implementation so both can evolve independently.                 |
| **Composite** | Combines objects in a tree-like structure (like folders inside folders).                    |
| **Decorator** | Adds new functionality to an object at runtime without altering the original code.          |
| **Facade**    | Provides a simplified interface to a complex system (like a remote control üõèÔ∏è).            |
| **Flyweight** | Shares common objects to save memory when dealing with lots of similar objects.             |
| **Proxy**     | Acts as a substitute or representative for another object (like an ATM card for your bank). |

---

## üîß Purpose of Structural Patterns

* Organize object relationships and structures
* Enable **code reuse** without modifying original classes
* Provide **flexibility and extensibility** to the software design
* Make it easier to **scale and maintain** large codebases

---

## üèõ One-Liner Cement for Your Brain:

* **Creational patterns** = "How do you create objects?"
* **Structural patterns** = "How do you structure and connect objects?"
* **Behavioral patterns** = "How do objects communicate and behave together?"

---

Now you're ready to tackle any structural pattern like a boss! üöÄ

# üí• Decorator Design Pattern

## üéØ Definition in One Line:

"A design pattern used to add new features or behaviors to an existing object at runtime without modifying its original code."

---

## üçï Real-Life Analogy: Pizza Toppings

Imagine you're making a pizza:

1. Start with a base pizza.
2. Add cheese.
3. Add olives.
4. Add jalapenos.

‚û°Ô∏è Each topping is a **decoration**.
‚û°Ô∏è You never modify the original base pizza ‚Äî you simply **wrap** it with new features.

This is exactly how the **Decorator Pattern** works!

---

## üíª Programming Analogy: Text Editor

Think of a `TextEditor` object. Now you want to add features like:

* Bold
* Italic
* Underline

Instead of changing the original `TextEditor` class, you:

* Create separate classes like `BoldDecorator`, `ItalicDecorator`, etc.
* Each of these wraps the base editor and adds its own behavior.

---

## üîß Technical Breakdown:

* **Component Interface:** The base interface (or abstract class) which all concrete components and decorators implement.

* **Concrete Component:** The original class whose behavior we want to extend.

* **Decorator Class:** An abstract wrapper class that implements the component interface and has a reference to a component object.

* **Concrete Decorators:** Extend the decorator class and override methods to add new behaviors.

---

## üß† When to Use Decorator Pattern?

* When you want to add new responsibilities to objects **dynamically at runtime**.
* When subclassing is impractical due to too many possible combinations of behaviors.
* When you want to avoid altering existing code (Open/Closed Principle).

---

## üßæ Real-World Software Examples:

### ‚úÖ Java I/O Streams:

```java
InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("file.txt"));
```

* `FileInputStream` = base component
* `BufferedInputStream` = decorator

### ‚úÖ Pizza Order System:

* BasePizza + CheeseDecorator + OliveDecorator

### ‚úÖ Text Formatting:

* Add styles (bold, italic, underline) to text objects

### ‚úÖ GUI Components:

* Add scrollbars, borders, shadows without changing the base component

---

## üéØ Final Summary:

Decorator Pattern is perfect when you want to:

* Extend functionality without altering original code
* Compose behavior flexibly at runtime

**Think: Pizza toppings, Java Streams, and dynamic UI layers ‚Äî all thanks to Decorator Pattern!**

---

## Real-Life Example: Pizza Order System using Decorator Design Pattern

### Problem Statement:

You have a pizza ordering system. Customers want different combinations of toppings:

* Customer A: Cheese
* Customer B: Cheese + Mushroom
* Customer C: Cheese + Mushroom + Olive

If you create a new class for each combination:

```java
CheesePizza {}
CheeseMushroomPizza {}
CheeseMushroomOlivePizza {}
```

‚û°Ô∏è This leads to **class explosion**!
100 toppings = 1000s of combinations = 1000s of classes ‚ùå

### ‚úÖ Solution: Use Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern allows you to add features to objects **dynamically** at runtime without altering the existing class structure.

---

### Step 1: Base Interface

```java
interface Pizza {
    String getDescription();
    int getCost();
}
```

### Step 2: Base Class

```java
class PlainPizza implements Pizza {
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Plain Pizza";
    }
    public int getCost() {
        return 100;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Topping Decorators (Cheese, Mushroom, Olive)

Each decorator:

* Implements the Pizza interface
* Accepts a Pizza object to wrap
* Enhances getDescription() and getCost()

#### CheeseDecorator

```java
class CheeseDecorator implements Pizza {
    private Pizza base;

    public CheeseDecorator(Pizza base) {
        this.base = base;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return base.getDescription() + ", Cheese";
    }

    public int getCost() {
        return base.getCost() + 30;
    }
}
```

#### MushroomDecorator

```java
class MushroomDecorator implements Pizza {
    private Pizza base;

    public MushroomDecorator(Pizza base) {
        this.base = base;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return base.getDescription() + ", Mushroom";
    }

    public int getCost() {
        return base.getCost() + 20;
    }
}
```

#### OliveDecorator

```java
class OliveDecorator implements Pizza {
    private Pizza base;

    public OliveDecorator(Pizza base) {
        this.base = base;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return base.getDescription() + ", Olive";
    }

    public int getCost() {
        return base.getCost() + 25;
    }
}
```

### üçï Order a Pizza:

```java
Pizza order = new OliveDecorator(
                    new MushroomDecorator(
                        new CheeseDecorator(
                            new PlainPizza()
                        )
                    )
                );
```

### Output:

```
Description: Plain Pizza, Cheese, Mushroom, Olive
Cost: ‚Çπ100 + ‚Çπ30 + ‚Çπ20 + ‚Çπ25 = ‚Çπ175
```

---

### üî• Key Takeaways:

* Each topping is a decorator.
* Toppings are chained (wrapped) like layers.
* Base pizza code is untouched.
* Each decorator adds its own logic ‚Üí modular and reusable.

---

### üéØ Final Summary:

The **Decorator Pattern** is used when you want to add features in a modular way **without touching the original code**.

Pizza toppings = Best real-life analogy for Decorator Pattern üíØ

# Adapter Design Pattern (Structural Pattern)

## One-Line Definition

"Adapter Pattern converts one interface into another interface clients expect. It bridges the gap between incompatible interfaces without modifying their source code."

## Real-Life Analogy: Charger Adapter

Imagine you have a US laptop charger with flat pins ‚ö° but you're in India where sockets are round.

* The US charger doesn't fit Indian sockets directly
* Instead of changing the charger or the socket (which is impossible), you use an **adapter**

### Result:

* US charger plugs into the adapter
* Adapter plugs into Indian socket
* ‚úÖ Compatibility achieved without modifying charger or socket

## Software Analogy

### Problem:

You have an existing class `OldLogger`:

```java
class OldLogger {
    void log(String msg) {
        // Old logging logic
    }
}
```

Your new system uses an interface `ILogger`:

```java
interface ILogger {
    void writeLog(String msg);
}
```

### Incompatibility:

`OldLogger` uses `log()` but the new system expects `writeLog()` from `ILogger`

### Solution: Use Adapter Pattern

Create an adapter that implements `ILogger` and internally uses `OldLogger`:

```java
class LoggerAdapter implements ILogger {
    private OldLogger oldLogger = new OldLogger();

    public void writeLog(String msg) {
        oldLogger.log(msg); // Adapting the method call
    }
}
```

### Result:

* The new system uses `ILogger` and calls `writeLog()`
* Internally, `log()` is called from `OldLogger`
* ‚úÖ Old class reused without changing its code

## When to Use Adapter Pattern

* You have legacy code (old classes) with a different interface
* You want to reuse old code in a new system
* You can't (or shouldn't) modify the existing code
* You need to connect incompatible interfaces

## Real-World Examples

| Real World Use        | Description                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Mobile Charger        | Adapts charger plug to fit socket                  |
| Card Reader           | SD card plugs into USB port using reader (adapter) |
| `Arrays.asList()`     | Converts array to List in Java                     |
| Spring HandlerAdapter | Adapts controllers to work with Spring Dispatcher  |

## Summary

**Adapter Pattern** helps two incompatible classes work together by wrapping one class with an adapter that translates calls into the expected format. It's like a smart bridge or jugaad system that enables code reuse and compatibility without rewriting original code.

---

## Adapter Design Pattern: Real-Life & Code Analogies

### ‚ú® Easy Real-Life Example: Mobile Charger Adapter

Imagine you're on a trip to Europe.

You have:

* ‚úÖ An Indian mobile charger (with 2 round pins)
* ‚ùå But the European wall socket only accepts 3 flat pins

**Problem:** Your charger doesn't fit.

**Solution:** You use a charger adapter:

* It converts your Indian charger's plug to fit into the European socket
* ‚úÖ Same charger
* ‚úÖ Same socket
* ‚úÖ No change to the actual charger or socket
* ‚úÖ Adapter just *bridged* the compatibility gap

**‚û°Ô∏è This is the Adapter Pattern in action!**

---

### üß† Programming Imagination:

You have an `OldCharger` class with a method:

```java
chargeWithRoundPins()
```

But the new system only accepts:

```java
chargeWithFlatPins()
```

**Mismatch!** Their interfaces are different, even if their functionality is the same.

**‚úÖ Adapter Pattern to the Rescue:**
You create a `ChargerAdapter` class that:

* Implements `chargeWithFlatPins()`
* Internally calls `chargeWithRoundPins()` from the `OldCharger`

Result:

* System sees the correct interface
* Old charger works without being modified
* Everything functions seamlessly

---

### üì¶ Another Easy Analogy: Headphone Jack üéß

You have a 3.5mm headphone

* But your new phone only has a USB-C port

**Solution:** Use a 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter

* ‚úÖ Headphone stays the same
* ‚úÖ Phone stays the same
* ‚úÖ No code or design change
* ‚úÖ Adapter enables compatibility

---

### üî• Final Bhai-Style Summary:

**Adapter Pattern** is used when:

* Two existing systems/classes/interfaces are not directly compatible
* But you want them to work together without modifying their original code

You create an **Adapter class** that:

* Acts as a *bridge* between the two
* Converts one interface to another

> Adapter Pattern = Compatibility jugaad between incompatible interfaces ‚Äî without touching their code. ‚úÖ

# Proxy Design Pattern (Structural Design Pattern)

## üî• What is the Proxy Design Pattern?

"The Proxy pattern creates a representative or placeholder object (proxy) that controls access to another object (real subject)."

It allows you to create an interface to control, delay, or enhance the access to the original object.

---

## üîê Real-Life Example 1: ATM Card (Proxy for Bank Account)

* **Bank Account** = Real Object
* **ATM Card** = Proxy Object

You do not go to the bank vault directly to withdraw money. Instead:

* You use your **ATM card**, which acts as a **representative**
* It **authenticates**, **validates**, and **communicates** with the bank on your behalf

‚úÖ **Controlled access** to your sensitive asset ‚Äî that's a Proxy!

---

## üßç Real-Life Example 2: Celebrity Bodyguard

* **Celebrity** = Real Object
* **Bodyguard** = Proxy

If you want to meet the celebrity, you cannot go directly. The bodyguard:

* Screens you
* Grants or denies access
* Controls how and when you meet

‚û°Ô∏è The bodyguard acts as a **proxy**, protecting and managing access to the real subject.

---

## üíª Types of Proxy in Programming

| Type             | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Virtual Proxy    | Controls access to objects that are expensive to create (e.g., large images)                 |
| Protection Proxy | Controls access rights based on roles (e.g., admin vs user)                                  |
| Remote Proxy     | Represents an object that exists in a different address space or machine (e.g., RMI in Java) |
| Smart Proxy      | Adds extra functionality like logging, reference counting, etc.                              |

---

## üßæ Real-World Software Examples

| Real-World Case | Proxy Role                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| ATM Card        | Acts as a proxy for your Bank Account      |
| VPN             | Proxy between your system and the internet |
| Java RMI        | Remote proxy object for remote services    |
| Hibernate ORM   | Lazy-loaded database objects via proxy     |
| Image Viewer    | Loads image on demand using proxy          |

---

## üéØ Final Summary (Bhai-Style üòÑ)

> Whenever you don‚Äôt want to give direct access to an object ‚Äî for performance, security, or convenience reasons ‚Äî you use a **Proxy Pattern**.

‚úÖ Proxy object **stands in place** of the real object
‚úÖ Controls how and when the real object is accessed
‚úÖ Keeps the real object secure, optimized, or lazily initialized

---

## üì¶ Java Analogy

* `RealSubject` = BankAccount
* `Proxy` = ATMCard
* `Client` = You

Proxy lets the client interact safely, smartly, and efficiently with the real subject.

# Proxy Design Pattern Explained

## Real-Life Example: Internet Cafe and Admin

Imagine you're in an internet cafe and you say:

> "I want to open YouTube."

But ‚Äî you can't directly open YouTube on your own.

There's an admin computer installed in the cafe.
The admin monitors which sites are being accessed.

If YouTube is allowed ‚Üí you get access.
If not ‚Üí you see a message: "Access Denied."

### Mapping to Proxy Pattern:

* **You (Client)** ‚Üí Wants to use the service
* **YouTube Server (Real Subject)** ‚Üí The actual resource
* **Admin (Proxy)** ‚Üí Acts as a gatekeeper between you and the YouTube server

The admin:

* Decides whether you can access the real server
* Can log your activity
* May show a fake page (like a "Blocked" notice)

This is exactly what the **Proxy Design Pattern** does.

---

## What is the Proxy Pattern?

In the Proxy Pattern, we create a class that acts as a substitute or placeholder for another object. This proxy class controls access to the actual object, and may also perform additional tasks such as logging, access control, lazy loading, etc.

---

## Roles in Proxy Pattern:

| Character      | Pattern Role |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| YouTube Server | Real Object  |
| Admin Guy      | Proxy        |
| You (User)     | Client       |

The **client does not interact directly** with the real object.
Instead, all requests go through the proxy, which may allow, deny, or modify the request.

---

## When to Use the Proxy Pattern?

* **Access Control / Security**
  E.g., Admin allows or blocks certain websites

* **Lazy Initialization (Virtual Proxy)**
  E.g., Loading large images only when needed

* **Remote Proxy**
  E.g., Accessing objects on another machine (like RMI in Java)

* **Logging / Monitoring**
  E.g., Keeping track of which services are being accessed

---

## Summary

The Proxy Pattern is a design pattern where you don't directly use the real object.
Instead, you go through a **proxy** that can:

* Control access
* Log actions
* Delay operations (lazy loading)
* Provide additional behavior

In short:

> A proxy acts on behalf of the real object ‚Äî like a smart gatekeeper between the client and the service.

---

# Virtual Proxy Design Pattern Explained

## What is Virtual Proxy?

Virtual Proxy is a type of Proxy Design Pattern where the creation of an actual object is delayed until it's really needed. This is also known as **Lazy Loading**.

> "When creating the actual object is expensive in terms of time or memory, we create a proxy that defers its creation until it is truly required."

---

## Real-Life Analogy: Online Food Menu App

Imagine you're using a food delivery app that shows a list of 100 dishes.

Each dish has a high-resolution image of **5MB**.

If the app loads all 100 images at once:

* The app will become **slow**
* **Memory usage** will shoot up
* **Load time** will increase drastically

### Solution: Use Virtual Proxy

Instead of loading the real images immediately:

* Show a lightweight placeholder using an **ImageProxy**
* Only when the user clicks **"View Image"**:

  * The proxy then creates and loads the **actual image object**
  * Displays the real image

The proxy acts like a real image but loads the heavy object **only when needed**

---

## In Programming Terms (e.g., Java Style)

```java
Image img = new ImageProxy("dish.jpg");
img.display(); // Image is loaded only at this moment
```

In this example:

* Initially, the `ImageProxy` holds a `null` reference to the real image
* When `display()` is called, the real image is created and shown

---

## When to Use Virtual Proxy?

| Situation                              | Why Use Virtual Proxy?              |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Heavy object creation (e.g., images)   | To save memory and reduce load time |
| Expensive DB calls / report generation | Avoid unnecessary computation       |
| Lazy loading UI components             | Don‚Äôt load UI elements until needed |
| Network-heavy objects                  | Load only when required             |

---

## Summary

‚úÖ Virtual Proxy delays the creation of real objects until absolutely necessary.

This leads to:

* **Better performance**
* **Efficient memory usage**
* **Fast and responsive applications**

> "Don't create what you don't need ‚Äî until you need it." That‚Äôs the power of **Virtual Proxy**.

---

# Security Proxy Design Pattern Explained

## What is a Security Proxy?

A **Security Proxy** is a type of Proxy Design Pattern that controls access to an object based on the user's identity, role, or permissions.

> "A Security Proxy determines whether a client is authorized to access the real object or not."

It acts like a **bouncer** who only lets in the VIPs.

---

## Real-Life Analogy: Office Building with Security Guard

Imagine there's a **VIP floor** in an office building ‚Äî like a **Server Room**.

Not every employee can go there.

When someone tries to enter:

* A **Security Guard** scans their ID card
* If they have permission ‚Üí Access is granted
* If not ‚Üí The guard says: "Access Denied"

### Mapping:

* **Employee (Client)** ‚Üí Wants access to the server room
* **Security Guard (Security Proxy)** ‚Üí Controls who gets in
* **Server Room (Real Object)** ‚Üí The resource being protected

---

## Programming Analogy

Suppose there's a class: `SensitiveData`

You don‚Äôt want every user to access it.

So, you create: `SensitiveDataProxy`

* When a method is called, the proxy checks the **user's role**
* If the role is `admin` ‚Üí it forwards the call to the real object
* If not ‚Üí it throws `AccessDeniedException`

---

## When to Use Security Proxy?

| Situation                | What the Proxy Does                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Admin dashboards         | Checks if the user has admin privileges      |
| Banking systems          | Allows only authorized users to transact     |
| File access control      | Ensures only valid users can view/edit files |
| API Gateways (JWT/OAuth) | Verifies tokens before allowing access       |

---

## Summary

‚úÖ A **Security Proxy** is used when access to a resource must be restricted based on user identity or role.

It:

* Prevents unauthorized access
* Adds a security layer without modifying the real object
* Keeps sensitive operations safe from untrusted clients

> Just like a VIP bouncer, it makes sure **only the right people get in.**

---

# Why Proxy and Real Object Implement the Same Interface

## Core Idea

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî the **Proxy Object** and the **Real Object** implement the **same interface**.

### But Why?

Because the **interface defines a contract** ‚Äî a common set of behaviors that both the proxy and the real object agree to follow.

This ensures that the **client code** (which uses the object) does not need to care whether it's using a real object or a proxy ‚Äî it just interacts with the **interface**.

---

## Real vs Proxy Object Responsibilities

| Type         | Responsibility                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Real Object  | Provides the actual functionality   |
| Proxy Object | Controls access, adds logging, etc. |

The client doesn't need to know what's behind the interface ‚Äî it just trusts that the object will behave as per the contract.

---

## Example in Java

```java
interface YouTube {
    void playVideo();
}
```

### Real Object:

```java
class RealYouTube implements YouTube {
    public void playVideo() {
        // Actual video plays here
    }
}
```

### Proxy Object:

```java
class ProxyYouTube implements YouTube {
    private RealYouTube realYouTube;
    private boolean isPremium;

    public void playVideo() {
        if (isPremium) {
            realYouTube = new RealYouTube();
            realYouTube.playVideo();
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access Denied. Upgrade to Premium!");
        }
    }
}
```

### Client Code:

```java
YouTube yt = new ProxyYouTube();
yt.playVideo(); // Client doesn't care if it's proxy or real
```

---

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Loose Coupling**:
Client remains unaware of whether it‚Äôs interacting with the real object or the proxy.

‚úÖ **Flexibility**:
You can add or swap out proxies without changing the client code.

‚úÖ **Maintainability**:
Concerns like access control, logging, caching can be isolated in the proxy class.

---

## Summary

Yes ‚Äî both the **proxy** and the **real object** implement the same interface so that:

* The client treats them interchangeably
* The system stays flexible and loosely coupled
* Proxies can seamlessly substitute the real object when needed

---

# Facade Design Pattern Explained

## Core Idea

The **Facade Pattern** simplifies complex systems by providing a single unified interface to multiple subsystems.

> "It hides the complexity of the system and provides an easy-to-use interface to the client."

---

## Real-Life Analogy: TV Remote Control

A modern TV system involves many subsystems:

* Screen System
* Sound System
* Power System
* Cable/Input System (HDMI, USB, Netflix, etc.)

### Without Facade:

To turn on the TV, you would need to manually:

* Turn on the screen
* Set up the sound
* Choose the input (HDMI, cable, etc.)
* Adjust brightness and volume

### With Facade:

Just press one button: **Power On**

* The remote (facade) handles all internal operations:

  * Powers on the screen
  * Sets sound and input
  * Adjusts volume and brightness

‚úÖ This is exactly what the **Facade Pattern** does ‚Äî simplifies complex actions with a single interface.

---

## Programming Analogy

Imagine a system with the following components:

* `VideoPlayer`
* `AudioPlayer`
* `SubtitlesManager`
* `StreamingService`

### Without Facade:

```java
video.load();
audio.setTrack();
subtitles.enable();
streaming.connect();
```

Client code becomes **messy and tightly coupled** to subsystems.

### With Facade:

```java
class MovieFacade {
   void playMovie() {
      video.load();
      audio.setTrack();
      subtitles.enable();
      streaming.connect();
   }
}

// Client Code
movieFacade.playMovie();
```

‚úÖ Now the client interacts with just one method ‚Äî clean and simple.

---

## Real-World Examples

| Facade Use Case            | Explanation                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `java.util.logging.Logger` | Hides internal logging mechanisms                 |
| Spring `JdbcTemplate`      | Simplifies JDBC calls with a single method call   |
| Car Start Button           | Internally handles ignition, engine, fuel systems |
| Hotel Reception Desk       | One place for all guest services and support      |

---

## Summary

‚úÖ The **Facade Pattern**:

* Provides a **simple interface** over a **complex system**
* **Hides complexity** from the client
* Improves **readability**, **maintainability**, and **usability**

> Just like a TV remote or hotel receptionist ‚Äî it handles everything behind the scenes so you don‚Äôt have to.

---

# Facade Pattern: Hotel Receptionist Analogy

## Real-Life Analogy: Hotel Receptionist

Imagine you check into a hotel.

The hotel has:

* Room Service
* Laundry Service
* Restaurant/Kitchen
* Billing Department
* Security
* Spa

If you had to interact with each department separately, it would be chaotic and time-consuming.

### ‚úÖ Solution: Receptionist as Facade

You only talk to the **receptionist**.

You say things like:

* "Please send someone to clean my room."
* "Send food to my room."
* "I‚Äôd like to check out."

The receptionist internally:

* Calls the right department
* Coordinates the tasks
* You don‚Äôt need to know who is doing what

‚úÖ The **receptionist** acts as a **Facade** that provides a **single point of contact** for multiple services.

---

## Programming Analogy

Suppose your system has five classes:

* `RoomService`
* `KitchenService`
* `LaundryService`
* `BillingService`
* `SpaService`

If the client directly interacts with all of them, the code becomes messy and tightly coupled.

### ‚úÖ Use Facade:

```java
class HotelFacade {
   void requestFood() {
      // KitchenService.foodOrder()
   }

   void requestLaundry() {
      // LaundryService.pickup()
   }

   void checkout() {
      // BillingService.generateBill()
   }
}
```

Now the client only uses `HotelFacade` to access the entire hotel system.

‚úÖ One simple interface wraps the entire complex system.

---

## Summary

‚úÖ The **Facade Pattern** converts a **complex system** into a **simple and clean interface**.

* **Receptionist** = Facade
* **Hotel Systems** = Complex subsystems
* **Client (You)** = Wants easy and direct access

> Just like a hotel receptionist helps you access all services without needing to deal with each department individually, the Facade Pattern simplifies access to a complex subsystem.

# Facade vs Proxy Design Pattern

## Overview

Design patterns often look similar on the surface, but their **intent and use cases** differ greatly. Here's a **clear, story-style comparison** of the **Facade Pattern** and **Proxy Pattern**, so you never confuse the two again.

---

## One-Line Definition

| Pattern    | One-Line Role                                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Proxy**  | A representative or substitute that controls access to the real object |
| **Facade** | A single simplified interface to a set of complex subsystems           |

---

## Story-Style Analogy

### üîê Proxy Pattern (Security Guard Analogy)

Imagine you want to enter a **server room**. There‚Äôs a **security guard** standing at the door. The guard:

* Checks your ID
* Verifies your permissions
* Allows or denies access

‚û°Ô∏è You can‚Äôt directly interact with the server room.
‚û°Ô∏è The **security guard = proxy**
‚û°Ô∏è He controls **who gets access** to the real object.

---

### üõéÔ∏è Facade Pattern (Receptionist Analogy)

Now imagine you're at a **hotel**.
The hotel has multiple services:

* Room Service
* Kitchen
* Spa
* Billing
* Laundry

But you don‚Äôt interact with each one separately. You just talk to the **receptionist**:

* "Please clean my room"
* "Send dinner to my room"
* "I want to check out"

‚û°Ô∏è The **receptionist = facade**
‚û°Ô∏è Handles all the complexity behind the scenes
‚û°Ô∏è Gives you a **simple interface** to interact with many services.

---

## Bhai-Level Comparison Table

| Point                 | Proxy Pattern                             | Facade Pattern                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**           | Control or delay access to a real object  | Simplify access to a complex subsystem           |
| **Behavior**          | Acts as a substitute for the real object  | Provides a unified, simplified interface         |
| **Client Sees**       | Just a proxy (looks like the real object) | A simple, high-level interface                   |
| **Real Object**       | Hidden behind proxy, accessed through it  | Multiple classes hidden behind the facade        |
| **Real-Life Example** | Security guard, ATM card, admin login     | Receptionist, TV remote, home theater controller |
| **Design Intent**     | Protection / Lazy loading / Remote access | Simplification / Usability / Abstraction         |

---

## Final Summary

‚úÖ **Proxy Pattern** is about:

* **Replacing or guarding** access to the real object
* Used for **security, logging, remote access, lazy loading**
* Example: **Bouncer, VPN, ATM card**

‚úÖ **Facade Pattern** is about:

* **Simplifying** a complex system
* Used for **easier usage, abstraction, and cleaner client code**
* Example: **Receptionist, TV remote, hotel front desk**

> Remember: **Proxy protects. Facade simplifies.**

# Bridge Design Pattern Explained

## What is the Bridge Pattern?

The **Bridge Design Pattern** is a structural design pattern that decouples **abstraction** from **implementation**, allowing both to evolve independently.

> "Bridge Pattern separates *what is being done* from *how it is done* by using composition instead of inheritance."

---

## Real-Life Analogy: Vehicles and Roads

Imagine you have multiple **vehicles**:

* Bike
* Car
* Truck

And various **types of roads**:

* Concrete Road
* Off-road Trail
* Highway

### Goal:

* Any vehicle should be able to drive on any road
* Without creating a new class for every combination (e.g., `BikeOnHighway`, `TruckOnTrail`, etc.)

### ‚úÖ Bridge Pattern Solution:

* Create a `Vehicle` abstraction that contains a reference to a `Road` interface
* Different vehicles extend the `Vehicle` class
* Different road types implement the `Road` interface

```java
new Bike(new Highway());
new Truck(new OffRoad());
new Car(new ConcreteRoad());
```

‚úÖ Now:

* You can add new vehicles independently
* You can add new road types independently
* They are connected through a **bridge**

---

## Why Use Bridge Pattern?

| Use Case                                                   | Reason                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Abstraction and implementation should evolve freely        | ‚úÖ Independent development         |
| Too many class combinations (Cartesian Explosion)          | ‚úÖ Reduce subclass explosion       |
| Avoid tight coupling                                       | ‚úÖ Increase code flexibility       |
| Need to change implementation without touching abstraction | ‚úÖ Maintain separation of concerns |

---

## Real-World Software Examples

* **Remote Control Systems**

  * *Abstraction* = Remote
  * *Implementation* = TV, Set-top Box, Smart Light

* **Java AWT/Swing GUI Toolkits**

  * *Abstraction* = Component (Button, Checkbox)
  * *Implementation* = Windows, Linux, Mac OS-specific rendering code

---

## Summary

‚úÖ The **Bridge Pattern** is all about:

* Separating **abstraction (what)** from **implementation (how)**
* Enabling them to be developed **independently**
* Providing a **bridge** that connects the two without tight coupling

> Think of it as:
> **Vehicle + Road**
> **Remote + Device**
> **UI Element + OS**
> Abstraction and implementation ‚Äî working together, but growing independently.

---

# Why Use the Bridge Pattern?

## The Core Question:

"Why should we separate abstraction and implementation with a bridge?"

Let's break it down with a real-world example and practical reasoning.

---

## üîß The Basic Thinking

### Without the Bridge Pattern:

Imagine you have:

* **3 Types of Vehicles**: Car, Bike, Truck
* **3 Types of Roads**: Highway, OffRoad, Concrete

If you directly connect them, you need a class for each combination:

```txt
CarOnHighway
CarOnOffroad
CarOnConcrete
BikeOnHighway
BikeOnOffroad
TruckOnConcrete
...
Total = 3 √ó 3 = 9 Classes üòµ
```

This leads to **class explosion** ‚Äî a massive number of classes as combinations grow.

---

## üöÄ With the Bridge Pattern:

We **disconnect** vehicles and roads.

* `Vehicle` becomes the abstraction
* `Road` becomes the implementation
* `Vehicle` holds a reference to a `Road`
* They are linked via a **bridge (interface)**

```java
Vehicle car = new Car(new Highway());
Vehicle bike = new Bike(new OffRoad());
```

Now:

* Vehicles and Roads are **separate**
* But they are **associated** via composition

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits of This Separation

### 1. Independent Development / Extension

* Add a new `Vehicle` without touching `Road` classes
* Add a new `Road` without touching `Vehicle` classes
* Promotes **Open/Closed Principle**

### 2. Efficient Combinations

* With 3 vehicles and 3 roads:

```java
// Only 6 reusable classes
new Car(new Highway());
new Bike(new ConcreteRoad());
```

* No need for 9 unique combination classes

### 3. Runtime Flexibility

```java
car.setRoad(new Highway());
car.setRoad(new OffRoad());
```

* Switch implementations **at runtime** without creating new subclasses

### 4. Low Coupling = High Maintainability

* Modular code
* Easy to change, extend, test, and debug

---

## üéØ Summary:

‚úÖ We **separate abstraction and implementation** using the **Bridge Pattern** to:

* Avoid class explosion
* Support independent evolution
* Improve modularity and flexibility

> Without the bridge, you‚Äôre stuck with a tangled mess of subclasses.
> With the bridge, your code becomes clean, scalable, and easy to manage üòé

---

# Decoupling Abstraction from Implementation ‚Äî Bridge Pattern

## ‚úÖ Yes! This Is the Core Purpose of the Bridge Pattern:

> "The Bridge Pattern exists to **decouple abstraction from implementation**, so both can vary independently."

---

## üîß What Does That Mean?

### Abstraction:

* The part **visible to the user**
* Examples: `RemoteControl`, `Vehicle`, `Shape`

### Implementation:

* The part that does the **actual work internally**
* Examples: `SamsungTV`, `LGTV`, `Highway`, `RedColor`, etc.

---

## üîó Without the Bridge Pattern:

If abstraction and implementation are **tightly coupled**, then for every new combination you need a new class:

```java
BasicRemoteSamsung
AdvancedRemoteLG
UltraRemoteSony
```

‚û°Ô∏è This leads to **class explosion** üí£

---

## üîó With the Bridge Pattern:

The solution is simple:

* The **Abstraction** class holds a **reference** to an **Implementation interface**
* Both are **separate** but linked via a **bridge**

Now:

* You can extend Abstraction without touching Implementation
* You can extend Implementation without touching Abstraction

‚úÖ Total flexibility and maintainability üî•

---

## üì¶ Example: TV & RemoteControl

| Role                    | Class Name            |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Abstraction             | `RemoteControl`       |
| Refined Abstraction     | `AdvancedRemote`      |
| Implementation          | `TV` (interface)      |
| Concrete Implementation | `SamsungTV`, `SonyTV` |

### Structure:

```java
RemoteControl has a reference to TV
```

Now, you can build new remotes (`AdvancedRemote`) or new TVs (`LGTV`) independently.

---

## üéØ Final Bhai-Line Summary:

‚úÖ The **Bridge Pattern** is **100% used to decouple abstraction from implementation**, so that:

* Both can be **developed and extended independently**
* **Class explosion** is avoided
* Code becomes **reusable, flexible, maintainable, and scalable**

> Bridge Pattern = Flexible design that grows without chaos.

---

# Bridge Pattern vs Adapter Pattern

Understanding the **Bridge Pattern** and **Adapter Pattern** is essential ‚Äî they may look similar but solve **very different problems**. Here's a permanent, crystal-clear comparison.

---

## üéØ Key Differences

| Aspect           | Bridge Pattern                                                   | Adapter Pattern                                                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**      | Separate abstraction from implementation                         | Make incompatible interfaces work together                        |
| **When to Use**  | When abstraction and implementation need to evolve independently | When you want to use an existing class with a different interface |
| **Design Time**  | Used during system **design**                                    | Used **after-the-fact** to reuse existing code                    |
| **Relationship** | Between **Abstraction ‚Üî Implementation**                         | Between **Client ‚Üî Adaptee** (resolves interface mismatch)        |
| **Flexibility**  | High ‚Äî both sides can grow independently                         | Low ‚Äî fixes a specific incompatibility                            |

---

## üí° Real-Life Analogies

### üîå Adapter Pattern = Charger Plug Adapter

* You have an **Apple charger** (US plug)
* But your **wall socket** is an **Indian socket**
* You use an **adapter** to make them work together

‚û°Ô∏è You **reuse the existing charger**
‚û°Ô∏è You **don‚Äôt change client or charger code**, just adapt the interface

### üåâ Bridge Pattern = Remote Control & TV

* `RemoteControl` is the **abstraction**
* `TV` is the **implementation**
* Bridge connects them:

```java
new AdvancedRemote(new SamsungTV());
```

‚û°Ô∏è You can build new remotes AND new TVs independently
‚û°Ô∏è This is **planned during design** for future scalability

---

## ü§Ø Super Simple Summary Table

| Situation                                   | Use Pattern |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Designing a new system with multiple layers | **Bridge**  |
| Integrating legacy or third-party code      | **Adapter** |

---

## ‚úÖ Final Bhai-Style Summary

### üß± Bridge Pattern:

* Used **at design time**
* Separates abstraction from implementation
* Enables **independent evolution** of both sides
* Good for **scalability and flexibility**

### üîå Adapter Pattern:

* Used **to fix interface mismatches**
* Helps **reuse old/incompatible code**
* Acts like a **converter**
* Ideal for **quick fixes and legacy integration**

> Remember:
> **Bridge = Long-term scalability**
> **Adapter = Short-term compatibility**

# Composite Design Pattern Explained

## üí• What Is the Composite Design Pattern?

> "Composite Pattern allows you to treat a **single object** and a **group of objects** in the **same way**."

It is used to build **tree-like structures**, where:

* **Leaf** = Single object
* **Composite** = Group of objects (including other groups or leaves)

---

## üå≥ Real-Life Example: File System

Imagine your laptop:

* You open the **Downloads** folder
* Inside you have:

  * `file1.txt`
  * `file2.jpg`
  * A sub-folder `MyPhotos`

When you delete or move the `Downloads` folder:

* All files and sub-folders inside it also get affected
* You **treat a file and a folder the same way**

‚û°Ô∏è `File` = **Leaf**
‚û°Ô∏è `Folder` = **Composite** (contains other files/folders)
‚û°Ô∏è Operations like `delete()`, `move()` etc. apply to both

‚úÖ This is **Composite Pattern** in action!

---

## üß† Programming Perspective

1. Create an interface `Component` with method `display()`
2. `File` class implements `Component` and defines `display()`
3. `Folder` class also implements `Component`, but:

   * It holds a **list of Components** (can be files or folders)
   * It iterates over that list in its `display()` method

```java
Component file1 = new File("resume.pdf");
Component folder = new Folder("Documents");
folder.add(file1);
folder.display();
```

* Whether you call `display()` on a `File` or `Folder`, it works the same way

---

## üßæ Real-World Software Examples

| Real Concept      | Description                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **File System**   | Folders containing files or folders             |
| **UI Components** | Panels containing buttons, sliders, text fields |
| **Organization**  | Managers (Composite) and Employees (Leaf)       |
| **Menus**         | MenuItems and Submenus treated uniformly        |

---

## üéØ Bhai-Style Final Summary

‚úÖ Composite Pattern helps you:

* Create a **tree structure**
* Treat **single** and **grouped objects** the same way
* Perform operations like `display()`, `delete()`, or `execute()` uniformly

> Just like a folder and file ‚Äî you can act on both using the same code!

‚ûï Results in **simple, clean, and maintainable** code
‚ûï Reduces special-case logic for handling group vs individual objects

# Composite Pattern Explained ‚Äî Real-Life Company Story Style

## üå≥ Real-Life Story: Company Structure

Imagine you're the **CEO** of a company. The structure looks like this:

```
CEO
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Manager1
 ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Employee1
 ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Employee2
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Manager2
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Employee3
```

### Key Insight:

* `CEO` is an employee
* `Manager` is also an employee
* `Employee` is obviously an employee

‚û°Ô∏è Everyone shares a **common role**, even though their responsibilities differ.

We treat them all using the same method: `showDetails()`

---

## ‚úÖ Two Main Components in Composite Pattern:

### 1. **Leaf** (Simple Object)

* Example: `Employee`
* Implements `showDetails()` to show just their own details

### 2. **Composite** (Group Object)

* Example: `Manager`, `CEO`
* Also implements `showDetails()`

  * Shows their own name/details
  * Then calls `showDetails()` on all subordinates

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è This Is Composite Pattern:

> "Where both **individual** and **group** objects are treated uniformly via a common interface."

* A `Leaf` performs only its own task
* A `Composite` performs its task **and** delegates to child components

---

## üì¶ Common Use Cases

| Scenario          | Leaf            | Composite    |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| File Explorer     | File            | Folder       |
| Menu Bar          | Menu Item       | Submenu      |
| Company Hierarchy | Employee        | Manager/CEO  |
| GUI Components    | Button, TextBox | Panel, Frame |

---

## üß† Bhai-Style Summary:

‚úÖ Use **Composite Pattern** when you have a **hierarchy** of objects like:

* Single item (file, employee)
* Group of items (folder, manager)

‚û°Ô∏è And you want to **perform the same operations** on both ‚Äî like `delete()`, `showDetails()`, or `render()`

---

## üß™ Java Structure (Optional Implementation Plan)

```java
interface Employee {
    void showDetails();
}

class Developer implements Employee {
    private String name;
    public Developer(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Developer: " + name);
    }
}

class Manager implements Employee {
    private String name;
    private List<Employee> subordinates = new ArrayList<>();

    public Manager(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void add(Employee emp) {
        subordinates.add(emp);
    }

    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Manager: " + name);
        for (Employee emp : subordinates) {
            emp.showDetails();
        }
    }
}
```

> You can now call `showDetails()` on any `Employee` type ‚Äî whether it's a Developer or a Manager with a team!

# Flyweight Pattern Explained ‚Äî Real-Life Memory Saver Story

## üí° One-Liner Definition:

**"Flyweight Pattern is used when we have thousands or lakhs of objects that share common data ‚Äî so we share that common part to save memory."**

---

## üçÉ Real-Life Example: Text Editor Characters

Imagine you're building a text editor like MS Word.
Someone writes:

```
AAAAAAABBBBBBBBBCCCCCCDDDDD
```

* A appears 7 times
* B appears 9 times
* C appears 6 times
* D appears 5 times

If you create a new object for each character instance:

* It would consume a lot of memory
* But all A‚Äôs have same style, font, size, etc.

### ‚úÖ Solution ‚Äî Flyweight:

* Create only **1 object** for `A`
* Reuse it wherever needed
* Just pass external info like **position** (x, y)

‚û°Ô∏è Same object reused repeatedly = memory saved = performance boosted üöÄ

---

## üî• Key Concept:

Flyweight pattern separates **object state** into two parts:

| State Type      | Description             | Shared? |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| Intrinsic State | Constant, internal data | ‚úÖ Yes   |
| Extrinsic State | Changing, external data | ‚ùå No    |

**Example:**

* Intrinsic: `'A'`, font = Arial
* Extrinsic: (x, y) position, color

---

## üß† Programming Use Cases

| Use Case         | Why Flyweight Works             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Text Editor      | Characters repeat often         |
| Game Development | Thousands of bullets/trees/etc. |
| Maps             | Same icon used in many places   |
| Chess Game       | Limited piece types             |

---

## üì¶ Flyweight Pattern Structure

| Component           | Role                                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Flyweight`         | Interface defining common methods                                     |
| `ConcreteFlyweight` | Implements Flyweight; shared object reused                            |
| `FlyweightFactory`  | Manages and returns shared Flyweight objects                          |
| `Client`            | Uses Flyweight objects and provides extrinsic data like position etc. |

---

## ‚úÖ Bhai-Style Summary:

Flyweight Pattern is perfect when:

* You need **lots of similar objects**
* And want to **save memory** by reusing common internal data

### ‚ûï Intrinsic State = Shared data

### ‚ûï Extrinsic State = Provided by client (e.g., position)

**Examples:** Characters, Trees, Map Pins, Chess Pieces etc.

**Result:**

* Less memory usage
* Cleaner, more optimized code
* High performance in systems like editors, games, UI frameworks
