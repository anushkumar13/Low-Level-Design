# Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)

Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) is a software development process in which real-world problems are analyzed and designed using object-oriented principles. In this approach, every part of the system is broken down into classes, objects, and their relationships.

## Simple Definition

OOAD means:
"Thinking, modeling, and designing software in an object-oriented style."
In other words, it involves converting real-world entities (like student, bank account, order) into classes and objects.

## OOAD 2-Part Process

### 1. Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA)

* Focuses on "What is the problem?"
* It understands the real-world problem and identifies objects, attributes, and their relationships.
* **Output**: Requirements + Conceptual Model

### 2. Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

* Focuses on "How will the solution be built?"
* It involves creating software class diagrams, defining methods, using inheritance, and applying polymorphism.
* **Output**: Blueprint of code (UML diagrams, design specifications)

## Example: School Management System

**OOA:**

* Identify objects: Student, Teacher, Course, Classroom
* Find relationships: A Student enrolls in a Course, a Teacher teaches a Course

**OOD:**

* Create classes: Student, Course
* Add attributes: name, id, courseList
* Add behaviors: enrollInCourse(), assignTeacher()
* Use inheritance: Person ‚Üí Student, Teacher

## OOAD Concepts

* **Class**: Blueprint of an object (e.g. Car)
* **Object**: Real instance of a class (e.g. myCar)
* **Encapsulation**: Combining data and methods together
* **Abstraction**: Showing only necessary information
* **Inheritance**: Reusing code by extending classes
* **Polymorphism**: Same method can behave differently in different contexts

## OOAD Tools

* UML Diagrams (Class Diagram, Sequence Diagram, etc.)

* Use Case Diagrams
* Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, etc.)

## Purpose of OOAD

* To make code modular and reusable
* To break a complex system into manageable parts
* To build software that mirrors real-world thinking

# UML (Unified Modeling Language)

## What is UML?

UML stands for **Unified Modeling Language**. It's like the **sketchbook** for software developers. Instead of drawing houses or superheroes, we draw **software systems**!

Think of UML as a way to **visually explain** what‚Äôs going on in a system. Just like an architect makes a blueprint before building a house, we use UML to create a **blueprint for software**. No guesswork, just clean and clear design!

---

## Purpose of UML

* To **visualize the system** like a map ‚Äî so everyone knows what‚Äôs going on
* To **understand and organize** different parts of the software puzzle
* To act as a **universal language** between developers, testers, and clients (no tech jargon confusion!)
* To give a **clear picture** before a single line of code is written ‚Äî planning saves lives... and projects

---

## What Does UML Model?

UML is great at showing:

* **Classes and Objects** (like Student, Teacher ‚Äî or Batman and Alfred?)
* **Relationships** (like inheritance ‚Äî because even code needs a family tree)
* **Behaviors** (what happens when a user clicks a button ‚Äî drama unfolds!)
* **System structure** (who talks to whom ‚Äî kind of like a WhatsApp group chat for components)

---

## Types of UML Diagrams

UML diagrams come in two flavors:

### 1. Structure Diagrams (aka "What the system *is*")

These show the bones and muscles of your system:

* **Class Diagram**
* **Object Diagram**
* **Component Diagram**
* **Deployment Diagram**

### 2. Behavior Diagrams (aka "How the system *acts*")

These show the system in action:

* **Use Case Diagram**
* **Sequence Diagram**
* **Activity Diagram**
* **State Diagram**

---

## Example: Library Management System

Let‚Äôs imagine we‚Äôre designing a Library System:

* **Class Diagram**: Includes `Book`, `Student`, `Librarian` classes ‚Äî all ready to play their parts
* **Use Case Diagram**: Student can "borrow book", Librarian can "add book" ‚Äî basic drama
* **Sequence Diagram**: Shows the conversation between student and system when a book is issued ‚Äî step-by-step like a scene from a movie
* **Activity Diagram**: Shows the whole process of issuing a book ‚Äî flowchart-style action

---

## Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you want to build your dream house. Would you just start piling up bricks? Nope! You‚Äôd first sit with an architect, sketch out the rooms, decide where the kitchen goes, and plan every little detail.

**UML is like that sketch ‚Äî but for your software.**
It makes sure everyone is on the same page and the system doesn‚Äôt turn into a construction disaster.

Think of it as your software‚Äôs **Google Maps** before you start the journey. Way better than wandering around lost in code!

# UML Basic Notations

UML (Unified Modeling Language) notations are visual symbols used to represent the components of software systems. These notations act like mathematical symbols (e.g., +, -, =) but are used in the context of software design.

---

## üìò 1. Class Notation

A class in UML is represented by a rectangular box divided into three parts:

```
+------------------+
|  Class Name      |   ‚Üê Top: Class name
+------------------+
|  Attributes      |   ‚Üê Middle: Variables / fields
+------------------+
|  Methods         |   ‚Üê Bottom: Functions / methods
+------------------+
```

**Example:**

```
+---------------------+
|     Student         |
+---------------------+
| - name : String     |
| - rollNo : int      |
+---------------------+
| + getName() : String|
| + setName(String)   |
+---------------------+
```

**Symbol Meanings:**

* `+` ‚Üí public
* `-` ‚Üí private
* `#` ‚Üí protected

---

## üìò 2. Object Notation

An object is represented by a box that contains the object name and its class:

```
+------------------------+
|  anush : Student       |
+------------------------+
```

---

## üìò 3. Use Case Notation

In use case diagrams:

* **Actor** ‚Üí Represented by a stickman symbol (external user/system)
* **Use Case** ‚Üí Represented by an oval shape (functionality)

**Example:**

```
[Stickman] ---- (Issue Book)
```

---

## üìò 4. Relationship Arrows

| Relationship Type | Symbol                    | Meaning                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Association       | Solid line                | General connection between classes |
| Inheritance       | Hollow triangle arrow     | "is-a" relationship                |
| Aggregation       | Hollow diamond            | Whole-part (but independent)       |
| Composition       | Filled black diamond      | Whole-part (tightly dependent)     |
| Dependency        | Dashed arrow              | Temporary use                      |
| Realization       | Dashed line with triangle | Interface implementation           |

---

## üìò 5. Multiplicity

Multiplicity shows how many objects are linked to another.

| Notation | Meaning      |
| -------- | ------------ |
| 1        | Exactly one  |
| 0..1     | Zero or one  |
| \*       | Zero or many |
| 1..\*    | At least one |

**Example:**
A student can enroll in many courses:

```
Student ---- 1     * ---- Course
```

---

## ü§î Real-Life Analogy

Think of a UML diagram as a map, and these notations as map symbols. Just like an arrow on a road map shows direction, an arrow in UML shows inheritance or relationships.

---

## üéØ Summary Table

| UML Element  | Symbol Type            | Use                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Class        | Rectangle with 3 parts | Show class structure   |
| Object       | Box with object\:class | Show real instance     |
| Actor        | Stickman               | External user          |
| Use Case     | Oval                   | Functionality          |
| Inheritance  | Hollow triangle arrow  | Child ‚Üí Parent         |
| Aggregation  | Hollow diamond         | Whole-part             |
| Composition  | Filled diamond         | Strong whole-part      |
| Multiplicity | Numbers like 1..\*, \* | Count of relationships |

---

These basic notations form the building blocks of all UML diagrams and are essential for visualizing and designing software systems effectively.

---

# Object Inside Object in UML and OOP

When designing UML diagrams or thinking about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), sometimes we need to represent one object inside another. This is a common real-world concept and is visualized using a specific format in UML object diagrams.

---

## üî∂ Format:

To represent an object and its class:

```
<objectName> : <ClassName>
```

If the object has properties (fields/attributes), they are shown within the box.

---

## üîß Example 1: Simple Object

### Java Classes:

```java
class Address {
    String city;
    String pincode;
}

class Student {
    String name;
    int roll;
    Address address;  // ‚Üê Object inside object
}
```

### UML Object Diagram Representation:

```
+------------------------------+
| student1 : Student           |
+------------------------------+
| name = "Anush"               |
| roll = 101                   |
| address = addr1 : Address    |
+------------------------------+

+-----------------------------+
| addr1 : Address             |
+-----------------------------+
| city = "Patna"              |
| pincode = "800001"          |
+-----------------------------+
```

---

## üí° Important Observations:

* **Object Name:** `student1`, `addr1`
* **Class Name:** `Student`, `Address`
* `address = addr1 : Address` ‚Üí This means the `student1` object has a reference to another object named `addr1`, which is of class `Address`.
* You can represent that referenced object (`addr1`) separately in full detail.

---

## ü§î Real-life Analogy:

Imagine a person named Anush (represented by the `Student` class). He has an address (an `Address` object) which includes the city and pincode.

So:

* **Anush** is the student (object `student1`)
* His **address** is another object (`addr1`) that holds `city = Patna` and `pincode = 800001`

This shows how one object can hold a reference to another object, making our models closer to real-world structures.

---

This concept is essential in both UML and OOP when dealing with compositions or references between objects.

---

# UML Interface Notations

In UML diagrams, interfaces can be represented using two popular notations. Both are correct, and the choice depends on your use-case and preference.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Lollipop Notation (Shorthand Notation)

This is a simplified notation commonly used in class diagrams when you want to depict an interface as a service. The interface is shown as a small circle (‚ö™) connected to the class that implements it.

### üß† Example:

```
   ‚ö™ IPrinter
     |
     |
   Printer
```

* `IPrinter` is the interface
* `Printer` is the class implementing the interface
* ‚ö™ is called the "lollipop"

This notation is more visual and abstract, used when detailed operations of the interface aren't necessary to show.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Box Notation (Detailed Notation)

This notation is more descriptive and looks similar to class representation. The main differences are:

* The keyword `<<interface>>` is written above the interface name
* The relationship between the interface and the implementing class is shown using a **dashed line with a hollow triangle**, called a realization arrow

### üß™ Example:

```
+------------------------+
| <<interface>> IPrinter |
+------------------------+
| + printDocument()      |
+------------------------+

          ‚ñ≤
          |
    (dashed line)
          |
+------------------+
|    Printer       |
+------------------+
| + printDocument()|
+------------------+
```

---

## üß† Symbols and Their Meaning

| Symbol / Shape          | Meaning                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `<<interface>>`         | Indicates it is an interface    |
| Dashed arrow + triangle | Realization (implements)        |
| Lollipop (‚ö™)            | Interface in shorthand notation |
| Rectangle               | Interface or class body         |

---

## ü§î Real-life Analogy

Think of an interface as a **contract** ‚Äî like a government tender that outlines what work needs to be done, but not who will do it.

The company (class) that accepts the tender agrees to fulfill the contract ‚Äî this is the implementation. In UML, this relationship is shown using a dashed arrow (realization).

---

Both notations help you visualize the relationship between interfaces and classes. Use the lollipop for simplicity, and the box notation when you need more details.

---

# UML Interface Declaration: Only Method Signatures

In UML diagrams, when representing interfaces, only **method declarations** (also called signatures) are shown ‚Äî not the method bodies (definitions).

---

## üí° Why Only Declarations?

An interface serves as a **contract**. It defines **what should be done**, not **how it should be done**.

The implementation details are provided by the class that implements the interface, not by the interface itself.

---

## üìò UML Interface Box Example:

```
+----------------------------+
| <<interface>> Animal       |
+----------------------------+
| + makeSound() : void       |  ‚Üê Only declaration
+----------------------------+
```

### Breakdown:

* `+` ‚Üí Indicates a public method
* `makeSound()` ‚Üí Method name
* `: void` ‚Üí Return type
* No method body is shown (‚ùå)

---

## üß† Comparison with Java Code

### Java Interface:

```java
public interface Animal {
    void makeSound(); // ‚Üê Only declaration
}
```

### UML Interface Box:

```
<<interface>> Animal
+ makeSound() : void
```

---

## ‚úÖ UML Class Implementing Interface

When a class implements an interface, the class must define the methods declared in the interface.

### UML Diagram:

```
<<interface>> Animal
+ makeSound()

       ‚ñ≤
       |
 (dashed line)
       |
    Dog
+ makeSound() : void
```

* `Dog` class implements the `Animal` interface
* `Dog` provides the method body for `makeSound()` in actual Java code

---

## ü§î Real-life Analogy

Think of an interface as a **rule book**.

For example:

* The rule book says: "Every Dog must have a method called `makeSound()`"
* But it doesn't say *what* the sound is.
* The `Dog` class will decide: maybe it's "Woof!"

This separation of declaration and implementation makes code more flexible and modular.

---

By showing only method declarations, UML interfaces clearly define expectations without enforcing implementation details.

---

# UML Actor Notation

In UML, an **Actor** represents any user or system that interacts with your software, but exists **outside** the system boundaries.

---

## üì¶ Simple Definition

An actor is a user, device, or external system that interacts with the software. Actors are primarily used in **Use Case Diagrams**.

---

## üé≠ Role of an Actor

* Exists **outside** the system
* Initiates or requests an **action** with the system
* **Not part of the system**, but uses or interacts with it

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è UML Notation

Actors are represented using a **stickman symbol (üë§)** with the actor's name written below it.

```
üë§
User
```

---

## üß† Example: Library Management System

| Actor          | Role               |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Student        | Borrows books      |
| Librarian      | Issues books       |
| PaymentGateway | Collects fine      |
| Admin          | Manages the system |

All of the above are considered **actors** because they interact with the system but are not part of its internal implementation.

---

## ü§ù Actor & Use Case Connection

Actors connect to use cases via lines or arrows, showing their interaction with a system function.

```
üë§ Student  -------->  (Borrow Book)
```

This means: The **Student** actor interacts with the system through the **Borrow Book** use case.

---

## üîÅ Types of Actors

| Type      | Meaning                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primary   | Directly interacts with the system (e.g., user)        |
| Secondary | Indirectly involved (e.g., another system or database) |
| Human     | Real people using the system                           |
| System    | External systems interacting with your system          |

---

## ü§î Real-life Analogy

Imagine an **ATM machine** as your system:

* **You (the user)** are an actor ‚Üí withdrawing cash
* **Bank Server** is also an actor ‚Üí checking account balance

These entities are not inside the ATM software but are necessary for interaction ‚Äî and that makes them **actors** in UML.

---

Actors help clearly define who or what interacts with your software, making the use case diagrams more expressive and meaningful.

---

# UML Component Notation

In UML, a **Component** represents a modular, replaceable, and independently deployable part of a software system ‚Äî essentially a functional unit that hides its internal workings and exposes an interface to the outside.

---

## üì¶ Simple Definition

A component in UML represents a **software module**, such as a `.jar` file, class file, microservice, module, or subsystem.

Its purpose is to say: ‚ÄúI am an independently working part within the larger system.‚Äù

---

## üß± What Does a UML Component Diagram Show?

* The components/modules of a system
* Their **interfaces**
* How components are **connected** or **dependent** on each other

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è UML Notation

A component is shown as a **rectangle** with two small rectangles (tabs) in the **top-left corner**. These tabs indicate that the element is a component.

```
  _____________
 |  _________  |
 | |       | | |   ‚Üê Tabs: symbol for component
 | |       | | |
 | |_______| | |
 |  Payment    |
 |  Service    |
 |_____________|
```

---

## üß† Example Components in an E-commerce System:

* `UserService`
* `PaymentService`
* `OrderService`
* `InventoryService`
* `EmailService`

Each of these is a separate component responsible for a specific functionality within the system.

---

## üîó Component Relationships

* **Lollipop symbol (‚ö™)** is used to show an **interface**
* **Dashed arrows** are used to show **dependencies** between components

### Example:

```
[UserService] ‚ö™‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ [AuthService]
```

This means that `UserService` depends on or uses `AuthService` via its interface.

---

## ü§î Real-life Analogy

Imagine your smartphone as a complete system:

* Camera app
* Dialer
* SMS
* Settings

Each of these is a **separate component** that does its own work. If one crashes or is removed, the whole phone doesn't crash.

UML uses the same idea to represent software components ‚Äî isolated but functional building blocks of the system.

---

## üéØ Summary Table

| Feature     | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Symbol      | Rectangle with 2 tabs on the top-left   |
| Represents  | Module, service, or subsystem           |
| Connects to | Other components via interfaces         |
| Used in     | Component Diagram                       |
| Purpose     | To represent modular software structure |

---

Component diagrams are especially useful in system architecture and microservice-based design, where you want to visualize how parts of a system interact and stay decou

---

# UML Node Notation

In UML, a **Node** represents the **physical device or environment** where your software is deployed or executed. It is primarily used in **Deployment Diagrams**.

---

## üì¶ Simple Definition

A Node in UML refers to a **hardware unit or runtime environment** that hosts software components. Examples include servers, cloud instances, mobile devices, routers, and more.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è UML Notation

Nodes are represented as a **3D box (cuboid)** ‚Äî a rectangle with a thick top-left corner to give a visual sense of depth.

```
 ___________________
|      <<node>>     |
|  Application      |
|     Server        |
|___________________|
```

---

## üß† Example Nodes

| Node Type          | Example             |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Application Server | JBoss, Tomcat       |
| Database Server    | MySQL, Oracle       |
| Mobile Device      | Android Phone       |
| Cloud Node         | AWS EC2 Instance    |
| External Device    | Printer, IoT Device |

---

## üîó What Can Be Inside a Node?

* **Components** (e.g., services or modules)
* **Artifacts** (e.g., `.jar`, `.war`, `.exe` files)
* **Connections** to other nodes (via communication paths)

---

## üß™ Example: Simple Deployment Diagram

```
 _____________________        _______________________
|     <<node>>         |      |      <<node>>        |
|  Web Application     |‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂|    Database Server   |
|    Server            |      |     (MySQL)          |
|_____________________|      |_______________________|
```

### Interpretation:

* The **Web Application Server** is a node running a Java Spring application.
* The **Database Server** is another node hosting a MySQL database.
* The arrow indicates communication between the two nodes.

---

## ü§î Real-life Analogy

Think of a **theater** as a server (node), and the **actors** as the software components.

* The theater is the **physical place** where performances happen.
* Similarly, in UML, a node is the **physical or virtual environment** where software runs.

---

## üéØ Summary Table

| Concept    | UML Meaning                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Node       | Physical device or environment           |
| Symbol     | 3D rectangle box (thick top-left)        |
| Used in    | Deployment Diagram                       |
| Contains   | Software components or artifacts         |
| Real-world | Servers, cloud instances, mobile devices |

---

Deployment diagrams using nodes help in visualizing the actual hardware/software mapping and architecture of distributed systems.

---

# UML Activity Diagram Explained

A **UML Activity Diagram** is like a flowchart that shows the step-by-step activities, logic, conditions, and flow of a process in your software ‚Äî from start to finish.

---

## üì¶ Simple Definition

An Activity Diagram is a type of UML diagram that visually represents the **workflow or process flow** of a system. It describes the **sequence of actions**, **decisions**, **loops**, and **conditions** that occur in a system.

---

## ü§î Real-Life Analogy

Think of ordering food on Zomato. The activity diagram would show:

* App is opened
* User logs in
* Chooses a restaurant
* Places an order
* Makes a payment
* Delivery is done

This complete flow, step-by-step, is represented using an Activity Diagram.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è UML Activity Diagram Notations

| Symbol                    | Meaning                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ‚óè (Filled circle)         | Start of the process              |
| ‚≠ï (Circle with inner dot) | End of the process                |
| Rounded rectangle         | Activity (e.g., "Enter password") |
| Diamond                   | Decision/Condition (if/else)      |
| Arrow (‚Üí)                 | Control flow (shows next step)    |
| Horizontal bar            | Fork/Join (parallel actions)      |

---

## üß™ Example: Login Process Activity Diagram

```
‚óè ‚Üí [Enter Username] ‚Üí [Enter Password]
     ‚Üì
   [Click Login]
     ‚Üì
   ‚óá (Is valid?)
     ‚Üìyes         ‚Üìno
 [Go to Home]   [Show Error]
     ‚Üì
     ‚≠ï
```

This shows the steps involved in a user login process and what happens if the password is incorrect.

---

## üéØ Uses of Activity Diagrams

* To visualize **system logic** in flowchart form
* To understand **business processes**
* To illustrate steps inside a **use case**
* To show **conditions**, **loops**, and **parallel tasks**

---

## üß† Activity Diagram vs Flowchart

| Feature             | Activity Diagram      | Flowchart             |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Part of UML         | ‚úÖ Yes                 | ‚ùå No                  |
| Object-oriented?    | ‚úÖ Yes                 | ‚ùå No                  |
| Swimlanes supported | ‚úÖ Yes (to show roles) | ‚ùå No                  |
| Used for software?  | ‚úÖ Mostly              | ‚úÖ But general purpose |

---

## üèÅ Summary

* **Activity Diagram = Step-by-step workflow**
* Starts from a filled circle, ends in a circled dot
* Shows **activities**, **decisions**, **flows**, and **end**
* Used to explain **processes**, **system behavior**, and **logic flows**
* Very helpful in detailing the inner steps of a **use case**

---

Activity diagrams are a powerful way to visualize and document the internal logic and flow of your software systems.

---

# UML Interaction Diagrams

**Interaction Diagrams** are a category of UML diagrams that show **how different objects or components in a system communicate with each other** ‚Äî focusing on the order, participants, and flow of messages.

---

## üì¶ Simple Definition

Interaction Diagrams are UML diagrams used to represent **how multiple objects or system parts interact to complete a use case**.

---

## üß© Two Major Types of Interaction Diagrams

### ‚úÖ 1. Sequence Diagram

* Focus: **The order in which messages are exchanged**
* Shows: Objects, the messages between them, and the sequence (top to bottom)

### ‚úÖ 2. Communication Diagram (a.k.a Collaboration Diagram)

* Focus: **Which objects communicate with which**
* Shows: Objects and their links
* Uses **sequence numbers** to indicate message order

## üîÅ Sequence Diagram Example: User Login Use Case

```
User       LoginController      AuthService       Database
 |               |                  |                 |
 | --login()-->  |                  |                 |
 |               | --verify()-->    |                 |
 |               |                  | --queryUser()-->|
 |               |                  |<--result--------|
 |<--success-----|<--return-------- |                 |
```

This diagram shows:

* User calls `login()`
* Controller calls `verify()`
* Service queries the database
* Result flows back up to user

---

## üîÅ Communication Diagram Example: (Same Use Case)

```
[User]  
   |1: login()  
   ‚Üì  
[LoginController]  
   |2: verify()  
   ‚Üì  
[AuthService]  
   |3: queryUser()  
   ‚Üì  
[Database]
```

* Focus is on who talks to whom
* Message sequence is indicated using **numbers**
* Layout is flexible (not strictly top-down)

---

## üìò Difference Between Sequence and Communication Diagrams

| Feature          | Sequence Diagram        | Communication Diagram              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Focus            | Time-order of messages  | Structural communication           |
| Visual Layout    | Top-down vertical       | Object-to-object network           |
| Message Order    | Shown by vertical order | Indicated by numbered arrows       |
| Use Case Clarity | Very clear step-by-step | Less focus on time but shows links |

---

## ü§î Real-life Analogy

Imagine a WhatsApp group with 4 people chatting:

* A **Sequence Diagram** shows: Ram sent a message first ‚Üí then Shyam replied ‚Üí followed by Mohan, etc. (shows **order**)
* A **Communication Diagram** shows: Who is connected to whom and talking, regardless of time (shows **connections**)

---

## üéØ Summary

* Interaction diagrams **show how objects interact** with each other
* **Sequence Diagram** = What happens **in what order**
* **Communication Diagram** = **Who talks to whom**
* Useful for showing the **detailed working of a use case**

These diagrams help developers understand both the structure and timing of interactions within a system.

# UML Diagram Types: Structure vs Behavior

UML (Unified Modeling Language) includes **13 official diagram types**, which are divided into two major categories:

* **Structure Diagrams**
* **Behavior Diagrams**

Let's understand them in a simple and beginner-friendly way:

---

## üß± 1. Structure Diagrams

Structure diagrams show **what components exist** in a system ‚Äî like classes, objects, software modules, and hardware setups.

| UML Diagram                     | Explanation                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class Diagram**               | Blueprint of the system ‚Äî shows classes, attributes, methods, and relationships |
| **Object Diagram**              | Snapshot of real-time objects ‚Äî a real instance of a class diagram              |
| **Component Diagram**           | Shows software modules or services and how they're connected                    |
| **Deployment Diagram**          | Shows where the software will be installed ‚Äî focuses on hardware and nodes      |
| **Package Diagram**             | Groups classes into folders (packages) for organization                         |
| **Composite Structure Diagram** | Shows internal parts of a class/object and how they interact                    |
| **Profile Diagram**             | Used for advanced cases ‚Äî shows custom UML extensions                           |

---

## üé≠ 2. Behavior Diagrams

Behavior diagrams show **how the system behaves or functions** ‚Äî the order of operations, decisions, conditions, and object behaviors.

| UML Diagram                      | Explanation                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Use Case Diagram**             | Shows who the users are and what actions they perform in the system      |
| **Sequence Diagram**             | Shows the order in which messages are exchanged between objects          |
| **Activity Diagram**             | Step-by-step workflow or flowchart of a process                          |
| **State Diagram**                | Shows the states of an object (e.g., on, off, loading) and transitions   |
| **Communication Diagram**        | Shows which objects communicate and in what sequence                     |
| **Interaction Overview Diagram** | High-level view of multiple sequences or activity diagrams               |
| **Timing Diagram**               | Focuses on time-based behavior of objects (when they turn on, off, etc.) |

---

## ü§î Real-life Analogy

Imagine you‚Äôre building a house:

* **Structure Diagrams** tell you **what exists** in the house ‚Äî rooms, furniture, appliances (like classes, objects, components)
* **Behavior Diagrams** tell you **who is doing what** in the house ‚Äî mom cooking in the kitchen, brother watching TV (like activity, state, sequence diagrams)

---

## üéØ Summary Table

| Type                   | Diagrams Included                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure Diagrams** | Class, Object, Component, Deployment, Package, Composite Structure, Profile      |
| **Behavior Diagrams**  | Use Case, Sequence, Activity, State, Communication, Interaction Overview, Timing |

---

This classification helps developers and designers choose the right diagram for the right purpose ‚Äî whether to show what the system looks like, or how it behaves.

---

# UML Use Case Diagram

A **Use Case Diagram** is a fundamental UML diagram that shows **how external users or systems (actors)** interact with your software.

---

## üì¶ Simple Definition

Use Case Diagrams illustrate **who (actor)** uses the system and **what tasks (use cases)** they perform.

---

## ü§î Real-life Analogy

Think of using the Zomato app. You, as the **user (actor)**, perform actions like:

* Logging in
* Searching for food
* Placing an order
* Making a payment

All these are **use cases**, and the interaction between you and Zomato can be represented using a **Use Case Diagram**.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Basic UML Symbols

| Element         | Symbol / Shape             | Meaning                         |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Actor**       | üë§ Stickman                | External user or system         |
| **Use Case**    | üîµ Oval                    | Functionality or action         |
| **System**      | üß± Rectangle box           | Boundary of the software        |
| **Association** | ‚Üí Line                     | Link between actor and use case |
| **Include**     | Dashed arrow `<<include>>` | Common reused use case          |
| **Extend**      | Dashed arrow `<<extend>>`  | Optional use case               |

---

## üß™ Example: ATM System

**Actors**:

* User
* Bank Server

**Use Cases**:

* Insert Card
* Enter PIN
* Withdraw Cash
* Check Balance
* Transfer Money

### Textual Layout:

```
                +---------------------------+
                |        ATM System         |
                |                           |
                |  (Insert Card)            |
                |  (Enter PIN)              |
                |  (Withdraw Cash)          |
                |  (Check Balance)          |
                |  (Transfer Money)         |
                +---------------------------+
                    ‚Üë        ‚Üë
                    |        |
                üë§ User   üñ• Bank Server
```

---

## üéØ Use of Use Case Diagrams

* To show **system functionality** to stakeholders
* To define the **scope** of the software
* To understand **functional requirements**
* To enable clear communication between **client and developer**

---

## üîÅ Extra Relationships

### Include

* When a use case **always** includes another use case.
* **Example**: "Login" includes "Validate User"

### Extend

* When a use case **optionally** adds another use case.
* **Example**: "Withdraw Cash" may extend "Print Receipt"

---

Use Case Diagrams are ideal for visualizing the **functional side** of your application and understanding **user interactions** at a high level.

---

# UML `<<include>>` Relationship in Use Case Diagram

The `<<include>>` relationship in UML Use Case Diagrams is used when a use case **always requires** another common use case as part of its process.

---

## üî∏ Simple Definition

When a main use case must call another use case **every single time** to complete its task, we show their connection using `<<include>>`. This means the included use case is **not optional** and is reused across different parts of the system.

---

## ü§î Real-life Analogy: ATM System

### Scenario:

You are using an ATM to withdraw cash.

* Before withdrawing cash, you **always** have to:

  1. Insert your card
  2. Enter your PIN

### Diagram View:

```
(Withdraw Cash)
      ‚Üë
<<include>>
      ‚Üë
 (Enter PIN)
      ‚Üë
<<include>>
      ‚Üë
 (Insert Card)
```

### Meaning:

* `Withdraw Cash` **includes** `Enter PIN`
* `Enter PIN` **includes** `Insert Card`

These steps are **mandatory** and will occur every time.

---

## üìò Example: Zomato App

### Use Case: `Place Order`

Steps that are **always required**:

* Login
* Select Address

### Diagram View:

```
(Place Order)
     ‚Üë          ‚Üë
 <<include>>  <<include>>
     ‚Üë          ‚Üë
 (Login)    (Select Address)
```

This shows that placing an order will always require the user to log in and select an address.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Points about `<<include>>`

| Feature                | Explanation                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Relationship Name      | `<<include>>`                                  |
| Meaning                | Common use case always included                |
| Arrow Direction        | From **main use case** ‚Üí **included use case** |
| Use When               | A functionality repeats in multiple use cases  |
| Compulsory or Optional | Compulsory (runs every time)                   |

---

## ü§ù `<<include>>` vs `<<extend>>`

| Feature      | `<<include>>`             | `<<extend>>`                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| When it runs | Always                    | Sometimes (optional)              |
| Direction    | Main ‚Üí Included           | Optional Use Case ‚Üê Main Use Case |
| Example      | Withdraw Cash ‚Üí Enter PIN | Withdraw Cash ‚Üê Print Receipt     |

---

## üéØ When to Use `<<include>>`

* When the same use case logic is reused across multiple use cases
* When a step is **mandatory** for a main use case
* When you want to **modularize repeated logic** to keep diagrams clean and consistent

---

The `<<include>>` relationship promotes **reusability**, **clarity**, and helps avoid duplication of functionality across multiple use cases.

---

# UML `<<extend>>` Relationship in Use Case Diagram

The `<<extend>>` relationship in a Use Case Diagram is used when a use case **optionally adds extra behavior** to the main use case depending on a certain condition.

---

## üî∏ Simple Definition

When a use case sometimes requires an **optional extension**, we show it using `<<extend>>`. This means the additional use case will only run **if a specific condition is met**.

---

## ü§î Real-life Example: ATM System

### Scenario:

Main Use Case: `Withdraw Cash`
Optional Use Case: `Print Receipt`

Not everyone wants a printed receipt after withdrawing cash. So it's an **optional** feature.

### Diagram View:

```
(Print Receipt)
       ‚Üë
 <<extend>>
       ‚Üë
 (Withdraw Cash)
```

### Meaning:

* `Withdraw Cash` is the primary action
* `Print Receipt` may or may not happen ‚Äî depends on the user's choice

---

## üçΩ Real-life Example: Zomato App

### Scenario:

Main Use Case: `Place Order`
Optional Use Case: `Apply Coupon`

Not every user applies a coupon. So it's an optional feature.

### Diagram View:

```
(Apply Coupon)
       ‚Üë
 <<extend>>
       ‚Üë
 (Place Order)
```

This means the system will only run the `Apply Coupon` use case **if the user chooses to do so**.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Points about `<<extend>>`

| Feature                | Explanation                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Relationship Name      | `<<extend>>`                                   |
| Meaning                | Optional use case adds extra functionality     |
| Arrow Direction        | From **optional use case** ‚Üí **main use case** |
| Use When               | The behavior is conditional or optional        |
| Compulsory or Optional | Optional (may or may not execute)              |

---

## üîÑ `<<include>>` vs `<<extend>>`

| Feature      | `<<include>>`                     | `<<extend>>`                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| When it runs | Always (mandatory)                | Sometimes (optional)              |
| Direction    | Main Use Case ‚Üí Included Use Case | Optional Use Case ‚Üí Main Use Case |
| Example      | Withdraw Cash ‚Üí Enter PIN         | Withdraw Cash ‚Üê Print Receipt     |
| Purpose      | Code reuse of shared logic        | Add optional features             |

---

## üéØ Summary

* `<<extend>>` is used when an extra functionality might occur depending on the situation
* The direction of the arrow goes from the **optional use case to the main use case**
* It helps in modeling **optional and condition-based behavior** in the system

---

## ü§ì Real-life Dialogue Style:

```
üßë‚Äçüíª System: "I'll always perform Withdraw Cash."
üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è User: "Hey, I also want a receipt."
üßë‚Äçüíª System: "Got it. I'll extend my flow and print it for you!"
```

# UML Class Diagram

A **Class Diagram** is one of the most fundamental and powerful UML diagrams. It represents the **blueprint** of your software ‚Äî showing classes, their attributes, methods, and how they are related to one another.

---

## üí° What is a Class Diagram?

A **Class Diagram** visually displays:

* The **classes** in your software
* Their **attributes** (data members)
* Their **methods** (operations)
* The **relationships** among classes (like inheritance, association, aggregation, etc.)

---

## üß± Structure of a Class Box

Each class is shown as a rectangle divided into 3 sections:

```
+----------------------+
|  Class Name          |   ‚Üê Class name
+----------------------+
|  Attributes          |   ‚Üê Variables or data members
+----------------------+
|  Methods             |   ‚Üê Functions or operations
+----------------------+
```

### üß™ Example: Student Class

```
+-----------------------------+
|        Student              |
+-----------------------------+
| - name : String             |
| - roll : int                |
+-----------------------------+
| + getName() : String        |
| + setRoll(int) : void       |
+-----------------------------+
```

### Symbols:

* `+` ‚Üí public
* `-` ‚Üí private
* `#` ‚Üí protected
* `: type` ‚Üí denotes the data type (like String, int, void)

---

## ü§ù Class Relationships in Diagram

### 1. **Association**

* General connection between classes
* Shown with a **solid line**
* Example: `Student` ‚Äî `Course`

### 2. **Inheritance (Generalization)**

* "Is-a" relationship
* Shown with a **hollow triangle arrow** from child to parent
* Example: `Dog` ‚Üí `Animal`

### 3. **Aggregation**

* Whole-part relationship (independent part)
* Shown with a **hollow diamond**
* Example: `Library` ‚Üí `Book` (Book can exist independently)

### 4. **Composition**

* Whole-part relationship (dependent part)
* Shown with a **filled diamond**
* Example: `House` ‚Üí `Room` (Room depends on House)

### 5. **Dependency**

* Temporary or occasional use
* Shown with a **dashed arrow**
* Example: `Student` ‚Üí `OTPService`

## üß† Summary Table

| Part          | Description                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Class Name    | Top section of the rectangle                |
| Attributes    | Variables with visibility and data type     |
| Methods       | Functions with return type and access level |
| Relationships | Inheritance, association, aggregation, etc. |

---

## üéØ Why Use Class Diagrams?

* To **visualize** the object-oriented structure of a system
* To **communicate design** clearly with your team
* To **plan and organize** your classes before coding
* To make future **maintenance and scaling** easier

---

## ü§ì Real-life Analogy

Think of building a house ‚Äî before you start construction, you draw a **blueprint** showing every room, door, and connection.

Similarly, before building software, a **Class Diagram** acts as the blueprint ‚Äî showing every class, its data, methods, and how it connects with others.

---

# UML Enumeration

## üí° What is Enumeration in UML?

In UML, **Enumeration** is a special type of class that represents a list of **fixed, constant values**. These are known as **enumerators**, and they are predefined and limited.

It is similar to `enum` in programming languages like **Java** or **C++**.

---

## üî∏ Real-life Example

Let's say we have a system where an `OrderStatus` enum defines these fixed states:

* `PENDING`
* `SHIPPED`
* `DELIVERED`
* `CANCELLED`

These statuses are constant and cannot be changed or added to by users.

---

## üß± UML Notation of Enumeration

An enumeration is shown using a **rectangle** with three sections:

* **Top**: `<<enumeration>>`
* **Middle**: Enumeration name (e.g., `OrderStatus`)
* **Bottom**: List of constant values

### üìä UML Example

```
+----------------------------+
| <<enumeration>>           |
|      OrderStatus          |
+----------------------------+
| PENDING                   |
| SHIPPED                   |
| DELIVERED                 |
| CANCELLED                 |
+----------------------------+
```

---

## üßê Java Code Equivalent

```java
public enum OrderStatus {
    PENDING,
    SHIPPED,
    DELIVERED,
    CANCELLED
}
```

---

## üîó Using Enumeration in a Class

When you have a class like `Order`, you can use the `OrderStatus` enumeration as an attribute type.

### UML View:

```
+------------------------+
|       Order            |
+------------------------+
| - status : OrderStatus |
+------------------------+
```

This means every `Order` object will have a `status`, which must be one of the values defined in `OrderStatus`.

---

## üéØ Summary

| Feature         | Description                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| UML Name        | Enumeration (`<<enumeration>>`)       |
| Type            | Special class with constant values    |
| Used For        | Predefined values like gender, status |
| Code Equivalent | Java/C++ enum                         |
| Example         | `OrderStatus`, `Gender`, `DaysOfWeek` |

---

## ü§î Real-life Examples

* **Gender**: `MALE`, `FEMALE`, `OTHER`
* **WeekDay**: `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, ..., `SUNDAY`
* **PaymentMode**: `CASH`, `CARD`, `UPI`

Enumerations are useful whenever your data needs to be limited to specific values only.

---

# Abstract Class in Java

An **abstract class** in Java is a class that **cannot be instantiated directly**. It's meant to be a **base or blueprint** for other classes, guiding them with a structure and rules they must follow.

---

## üí° What is an Abstract Class?

An abstract class is a special class that may contain:

* **Abstract methods** (methods without a body)
* **Concrete methods** (methods with full implementation)

It **cannot be used to create objects directly**. Instead, it serves as a parent for other classes to **inherit** from and **override** the abstract methods.

---

## üéì Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you have an abstract class called `Shape`.

Now, "Shape" is just an idea ‚Äî it could be a **Circle**, **Rectangle**, **Triangle**, etc. But every shape must have an **area()** method.

So the `Shape` abstract class might say:

> "Every shape must define its own area calculation."

The `Shape` class gives the **rule**, and the actual shape classes **implement the rule**.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Java Code Example

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void area(); // Declaration only, no body
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void area() {
        System.out.println("Area = œÄr¬≤");
    }
}
```

---

## üîç Features of Abstract Class

| Feature                              | Description                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `abstract` keyword                   | Used with class and methods              |
| Object creation not allowed          | Cannot create objects of abstract class  |
| Contains abstract + concrete methods | Both types of methods allowed            |
| Inheritance required                 | Must be extended by a subclass           |
| Can have constructors                | Yes, but called via subclass constructor |

---

## üìò Where is Abstract Class Used?

* When you want to define a **common structure** but leave implementation details to subclasses
* When you want to **enforce** that all subclasses implement certain methods

---

## ü§î Abstract Class vs Interface

| Feature         | Abstract Class              | Interface                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Object allowed? | ‚ùå No                        | ‚ùå No                                  |
| Method types    | Abstract + Concrete         | Java 8+ allows default/static methods |
| Keyword         | `abstract`                  | `interface`                           |
| Inheritance     | `extends`                   | `implements`                          |
| Fields          | Can have instance variables | Only `public static final` fields     |

> If you're confused about Abstract Class vs Interface, check out the full comparison in a separate doc.

---

## üéØ Summary

* An **abstract class** cannot be instantiated
* It can have both **abstract methods** and **normal methods**
* Subclasses **must override** the abstract methods
* Useful for **code reuse + structure enforcement**

# UML Access Modifiers Explained

Access Modifiers define **who can access a class, method, or variable**. In UML, these are represented with specific **symbols** to show the visibility level of elements in a class diagram.

---

## üí° What are Access Modifiers?

Access modifiers determine the **visibility scope** ‚Äî i.e., **who can access** a variable or method.

---

## üß± UML Notation Symbols

| Symbol | Access Modifier   | Meaning                                   |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `+`    | public            | Accessible from **anywhere**              |
| `-`    | private           | Accessible **only within the same class** |
| `#`    | protected         | Accessible in **same class + subclasses** |
| `~`    | package (default) | Accessible in **same package only**       |

---

## ‚úÖ Java Access Modifiers (with UML Symbol)

| Modifier    | UML Symbol | Accessible In                            |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `public`    | `+`        | Anywhere (worldwide access)              |
| `private`   | `-`        | Only within the same class               |
| `protected` | `#`        | Same class, subclasses, and same package |
| (default)   | `~`        | Only within the same package             |

---

## üß™ UML Class Example

```plaintext
+---------------------------+
|        Student            |
+---------------------------+
| - name : String           |   // private
| + roll : int              |   // public
| # college : String        |   // protected
+---------------------------+
| + getName() : String      |   // public method
| - setName(String) : void  |   // private method
+---------------------------+
```

---

## üîì Real-Life Analogy

Think of your house:

* `public` = The main gate is open to everyone
* `private` = Your personal locker, only you can use it
* `protected` = Your sibling's room, you and your family can enter
* `default` = Accessible only to people inside your society

---

## üéØ Summary

* UML uses `+`, `-`, `#`, `~` to **represent access modifiers** visually
* Java provides **4 access levels**: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `default`
* These control **who can access** data or methods inside classes

Understanding access modifiers is essential for **data encapsulation** and **safe software design**.

---

# UML Association

## üí° What is Association in UML?

Association is a UML relationship that shows a "connection" or "link" between two objects.
It simply indicates:

> "A class knows about another class"

That is, one class can use an object of another class.

---

## ü§î Real-Life Analogy

Think of the relationship between a **Teacher** and a **Student**:

* A `Teacher` class may have a reference to a `Student` object.
* Similarly, a `Student` class may know about a `Teacher`.

This mutual knowledge or connection is called **Association**.

---

## üß™ UML Example:

```
+-----------+           +-----------+
|  Teacher  | --------> |  Student  |
+-----------+           +-----------+
```

**Meaning:**

* `Teacher` knows about `Student` (i.e., the `Teacher` object holds a reference to `Student`).

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Types of Association

Association is the base UML relationship. It has 3 special forms:

| Type        | Meaning                                   | Symbol         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Association | Normal connection (knows each other)      | Line           |
| Aggregation | "Has-a" (part can live without the whole) | Hollow diamond |
| Composition | Strong "has-a" (part dies with the whole) | Filled diamond |

(\*Note: This file explains only Association. Aggregation and Composition can be covered separately.)

---

## üéì Multiplicity in Association

When two classes are associated, we can specify **how many objects** are connected to each other:

```
+----------+           +---------+
|  Teacher | 1       * | Student |
+----------+-----------+---------+
```

**Meaning:**

* 1 `Teacher` can teach multiple `Students`

---

## üåü Summary

* **Association** = A class holds a reference to another class ("normal connection")
* Shows a "uses-a" or "knows-a" relationship
* Most common relationship in OOP design
* Arrow shows direction of knowledge

---

## üí¨ Real-Life Examples of Association

| Association Type | Example             |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| One-to-one       | Person ‚Äî AadharCard |
| One-to-many      | Teacher ‚Äî Students  |
| Many-to-one      | Students ‚Äî College  |
| Many-to-many     | Student ‚Äî Courses   |

---

Association helps in designing object interactions and defining system relationships in a structured and visual manner.

---

# UML / Java Object Association

## ‚ú® What is Object Association?

**Object Association** refers to the relationship between two objects where **one object is connected to another** or **holds a reference to another**.

In simple terms:

> "One object knows about or uses another object."

This association starts at the **class level** (design) and comes to life at the **object level** (runtime) in code.

---

## ü§î Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine:

* A `Teacher` class
* A `Student` class

If a `Teacher` object holds a reference to a `Student` object, it means:

> **Teacher is associated with Student**.

---

## üìä UML Representation:

```
+----------+           +---------+
| Teacher  | --------> | Student |
+----------+           +---------+
```

The arrow signifies:

* **Teacher knows about Student**
* A reference exists inside Teacher

---

## ‚òïÔ∏è Java Code Example:

```java
class Student {
    String name;
}

class Teacher {
    Student student;  // ‚Üê Object Association
}
```

Explanation:

* The `Teacher` class has a variable of type `Student`
* This is **object-level association**

---

## üìÉ Object Association Types:

| Type         | Description                 | Java Representation       |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| One-to-One   | One husband - one wife      | `Wife wife;`              |
| One-to-Many  | One teacher - many students | `List<Student> students;` |
| Many-to-One  | Many students - one college | `College college;`        |
| Many-to-Many | Student joins many courses  | `List<Course> courses;`   |

---

## üéì Summary Table:

| Term               | Description                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Object Association | One object holds reference to another                  |
| In Java            | Via class variables (object references)                |
| In UML             | Arrow/line between classes to show connection          |
| Real-life example  | Teacher ‚Üí Student, Car ‚Üí Engine, Employee ‚Üí Department |

---

## üò≠ Common Confusion:

**Q: Are Class Association and Object Association the same?**
**A:**

* **Class Association** is at the **design level** (UML class diagram).
* **Object Association** happens at the **runtime/code level** when real objects are created and connected.

---

Object Association is a key part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and helps in building meaningful and interconnected software structures.

---

# UML Aggregation

## üí° What is Aggregation in UML?

Aggregation is a **special type of Association** that represents a "**has-a**" relationship where one object contains another, but **both can exist independently**.

In simple terms:

* One object contains or is connected to another
* **But the contained part can still live independently** of the whole
* Represented in UML with a **hollow diamond ( ‚óá )**

---

## üßê Real-Life Analogy

### Example 1: College - Student

* A college has many students
* If the college shuts down, students can still go to other colleges
* So the **college "has-a" student**, but **student can exist without college**

### Example 2: Team - Player

* A team has players
* If the team is disbanded, players can join other teams
* This is **aggregation**

---

## üìä UML Notation

```
+--------+         ‚óá‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ>      +---------+
| Team   |                      | Player  |
+--------+                      +---------+
```

* The **hollow diamond (‚óá)** is on the side of the "whole" (Team)
* The arrow points to the "part" (Player)

---

## üìä Java Code Example

```java
class Player {
    String name;
}

class Team {
    List<Player> players;  // ‚Üê aggregation
}
```

* `Team` holds a list of `Player`
* `Player` can exist independently from `Team`

---

## üß± Aggregation vs Association vs Composition

| Concept     | Symbol      | "Has-a" | Part depends on Whole? | Example           |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Association | ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ> | ‚úîÔ∏è      | ‚ùå No                   | Teacher ‚Üí Student |
| Aggregation | ‚óá‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ> | ‚úîÔ∏è      | ‚ùå No                   | Team ‚Üí Player     |
| Composition | ‚óÜ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ> | ‚úîÔ∏è      | ‚úÖ Yes                  | House ‚Üí Room      |

---

## üåü Summary

* **Aggregation** is a special "has-a" relationship
* The **part can live independently** from the whole
* Represented in UML with a **hollow diamond (‚óá)**
* Common examples:

  * Library ‚Üí Books
  * College ‚Üí Students
  * Team ‚Üí Players
* In Java, if one class holds another as an object reference and **their lifecycles are separate**, it is aggregation

---

# UML Composition

## ‚ú® What is Composition in UML?

Composition is a **strong type of association** in UML, which means:

> "If the whole object is destroyed, its parts are also destroyed."

It is a **"has-a" relationship**, but with strong dependency.

In UML, Composition is represented using a **filled diamond (‚óÜ)**.

---

## üßê Real-Life Examples

### üè† 1. House ‚Üí Room

* A House contains Rooms.
* If the House is destroyed, the Rooms are also destroyed.
* ‚úÖ **Room cannot exist without House**
* ‚Üí This is **Composition**

### üìö 2. Library ‚Üí Bookshelves

* Bookshelves exist only if the Library exists.
* No Library = No Shelves
* ‚Üí This is also **Composition**

---

## üìä UML Notation

```
+--------+         ‚óÜ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ>      +--------+
| House  |                      | Room   |
+--------+                      +--------+
```

* **Filled Diamond (‚óÜ)** is on the side of the whole (House)
* Arrow points to the part (Room)

---

## üìä Java Code Example

```java
class Room {
    String name;
}

class House {
    private List<Room> rooms = new ArrayList<>();

    public House() {
        rooms.add(new Room()); // Rooms are created with House
    }
}
```

* Room objects are created **only when** House is created
* Room is **not meaningful independently**

---

## üìÅ Composition vs Aggregation vs Association

| Concept     | UML Symbol        | "Has-a" | Part survives?   | Example           |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Association | ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí | ‚úîÔ∏è      | ‚úîÔ∏è (independent) | Teacher ‚Üí Student |
| Aggregation | ‚óá‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí | ‚úîÔ∏è      | ‚úîÔ∏è (independent) | Team ‚Üí Player     |
| Composition | ‚óÜ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí | ‚úîÔ∏è      | ‚ùå (dependent)    | House ‚Üí Room      |

---

## üîÑ Quick Real-Life Comparison

| Whole      | Part     | Relationship Type |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| School     | Students | Aggregation       |
| House      | Rooms    | Composition       |
| Team       | Players  | Aggregation       |
| Human Body | Heart    | Composition       |

---

## üåü Summary

* **Composition** = If whole dies ‚Üí part also dies
* Strongest form of association (tight coupling)
* Represented in UML with **filled diamond (‚óÜ)**
* Real-world examples: House ‚Üí Room, Book ‚Üí Chapter, Car ‚Üí Engine

---

# UML Sequence Diagram

A **Sequence Diagram** in UML is an **interaction diagram** that shows **how and in what order** objects interact with each other by sending messages. It focuses on the **sequence** of messages exchanged between multiple components.

---

## üé¨ Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you're ordering food on Zomato:

* You login
* The server verifies your login
* You search for food
* The server sends suggestions
* You place an order
* The server confirms the order

The sequence in which all these steps happen is shown by a **Sequence Diagram**.

---

## üí° What is a Sequence Diagram?

A **Sequence Diagram** illustrates the **time-ordered flow of messages** between objects or systems. It's used to visualize the **function execution order** and helps to understand the behavior within a **use case**.

---

## üß± Basic Components of a Sequence Diagram

| Symbol         | Meaning                                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Object**     | The top box in vertical column (with object name)     |
| **Lifeline**   | Vertical dashed line below object (object's lifetime) |
| **Message**    | Horizontal solid arrow (message sent)                 |
| **Actor**      | External user/system interacting with the system      |
| **Return Msg** | Dashed horizontal arrow (response or result)          |
| **Activation** | Thin rectangle on lifeline (when object is active)    |

---

## üß™ Example: ATM Sequence Diagram

### Actors & Objects:

* User (Actor)
* ATM Machine
* Bank Server

### Sequence Flow:

```
User        ATM           Server
 |           |               |
 |--------->| insertCard()   |
 |           |-------------->| validateCard()
 |           |<--------------| response
 |<----------| showOptions() |
 |--------->| withdrawCash() |
 |           |-------------->| processWithdrawal()
 |           |<--------------| approved
 |<----------| dispenseCash()|
```

---

## üìå Key Points

* **Left to Right**: shows actors and objects involved
* **Top to Bottom**: shows flow of time
* **Horizontal arrows**: messages sent from one object to another
* **Dashed arrows**: return messages/responses
* **Activation bar**: when an object is actively doing something

---

## ü§î When to Use a Sequence Diagram?

* To show step-by-step **function or process flow**
* In **client-server interactions**
* To model **method call sequences**
* To illustrate the internal working of a **use case**

---

## üéØ Summary

| Feature       | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Diagram Type  | Interaction UML Diagram                   |
| Focus         | Time-ordered message exchange             |
| Purpose       | To show how objects communicate over time |
| Example Usage | Zomato order process, ATM transaction     |

---

# UML Sequence Diagram: Types of Messages

Messages in a **Sequence Diagram** represent communication between objects over time. Each arrow shows:

* **Who sends** the message
* **Who receives** it
* **What is being communicated**

Understanding message types helps clarify how objects collaborate in a system.

---

## üí¨ Types of Messages in Sequence Diagram

### 1. **Synchronous Message ( ‚Üí )**

* **Definition**: Sender sends a message and waits for a response.
* **Analogy**: Function call that needs a return value.
* **Example**:

  ```
  User ‚Üí ATM : insertCard()
  ```

### 2. **Asynchronous Message ( --> )**

* **Definition**: Sender sends a message and continues without waiting.
* **Analogy**: Sending a notification or starting a thread.
* **Example**:

  ```
  App --> NotificationService : sendPushNotification()
  ```

### 3. **Reply / Return Message ( <-- )**

* **Definition**: Receiver sends a response back to sender.
* **Notation**: Dashed line.
* **Example**:

  ```
  ATM <-- BankServer : "Approved"
  ```

### 4. **Create Message ( ‚Üí new )**

* **Definition**: An object creates a new instance of another object.
* **Example**:

  ```
  User ‚Üí Order : new Order()
  ```

### 5. **Delete Message ( ‚úñÔ∏è )**

* **Definition**: An object destroys another object.
* **Notation**: Lifeline ends with an X mark.

### 6. **Self Message ( ‚Üª )**

* **Definition**: An object calls its own method (recursion or internal).
* **Example**:

  ```
  ATM ‚Üª : checkCardValidity()
  ```

# Lost and Found Messages in UML Sequence Diagram

Understanding **Lost** and **Found** messages helps you model communication even when the sender or receiver is unknown. These are useful for representing partial systems or when external actors are not shown in the diagram.

---

## üí° Lost Message

A **Lost Message** occurs when a message is sent, but the **receiver is unknown** or not present in the diagram.

### ü§î Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you send a message, but you don't know if or where it landed ‚Äî like sending a crash report when the app crashes and you don't know who receives it.

### üìò UML Notation

The arrow points outward with **no target object**.

```plaintext
Object A  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ>  [Lost]
   sendCrashReport()
```

---

## üí° Found Message

A **Found Message** represents a message that comes from **an unknown source**, where the **sender is not shown** in the diagram.

### ü§î Real-Life Analogy

You're sitting at home and receive an OTP from an unknown source ‚Äî you don't know who sent it, but you can use it.

### üìò UML Notation

The arrow comes in from outside with **no origin object**.

```plaintext
[Found]  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ>  Object B
   receiveRequest()
```

---

## üß± Diagram Summary

| Type          | Message Flow                  | Missing Side     | UML Symbol Description    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Lost Message  | Known sender ‚Üí Unknown target | Receiver missing | Arrow with no endpoint    |
| Found Message | Unknown sender ‚Üí Known target | Sender missing   | Arrow with no start point |

---

## üéØ When to Use These Messages

* When the **sequence diagram is partial**
* When the **external system is unknown or abstracted**
* When focusing only on a **subset of components**

---

## ü§ì Real Examples

### Lost Message

```plaintext
ClientApp ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ> [Lost]
   sendFeedback()
```

Client sends feedback, but the server or endpoint is not specified.

### Found Message

```plaintext
[Found] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ> AuthenticationServer
      receiveToken()
```

A token is received, but its origin is unknown.

---

Lost and Found messages add flexibility and realism to your UML Sequence Diagrams, allowing partial or abstracted system behavior to be modeled effectively.

# How to Draw a Sequence Diagram in UML

A **Sequence Diagram** helps visualize the **step-by-step flow of messages** between objects in a system, just like tracking a WhatsApp conversation!

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: How to Draw a Sequence Diagram

### ·æû0 Step 1: Choose a Use Case

First, decide what scenario or use case you want to represent with a message flow.

**Examples:**

* ATM withdrawal
* Zomato food order
* Login system
* Railway ticket booking

**Chosen Example:** `User logs into app`

---

### üßù Step 2: Identify Objects / Actors

List out who or what is involved in the interaction.

**Example:**

* `User` (Actor)
* `LoginPage` (UI)
* `AuthServer` (Backend)
* `Database`

---

### üß± Step 3: Draw Lifelines

For each object or actor, draw a vertical **dashed line** (lifeline) starting from a labeled box.

```
User       LoginPage       AuthServer       DB
  |             |               |            |
  |             |               |            |
```

These lines show the lifespan of each object during the interaction.

---

### ‚û°Ô∏è Step 4: Add Messages

Add **horizontal arrows** to represent messages passed between the objects.

**Types:**

* `‚Üí` Synchronous call (waits for response)
* `-->` Asynchronous call (doesn't wait)
* `<--` Return message

```
User       LoginPage       AuthServer       DB
  |------------->|                          |
  | enterLogin()                            |
               |------------->|            |
               | sendToServer()           |
                             |--------->| |
                             | validate()  |
                             |<---------| |
               |<-------------|           |
  |<-------------|                          |
```

---

### üçâ Step 5: Add Activation Bars (Optional)

Draw thin rectangles over lifelines to show when an object is actively processing a task.

---

### ‚ùå Step 6: (Optional) Show Lost/Found Messages

* **Lost Message:** Sender is known, receiver is unknown (arrow ends without a target)
* **Found Message:** Sender is unknown, receiver is known (arrow starts without a source)

---

### û∑æ Step 7: Label the Messages

Label each arrow to describe the interaction.

```
User ‚Üí LoginPage : enterCredentials()
LoginPage ‚Üí Server : validateLogin()
Server ‚Üí DB : checkUser()
DB ‚Üí Server : validUser
Server ‚Üí LoginPage : loginSuccess()
LoginPage ‚Üí User : showDashboard()
```

# Activity Diagram in UML

## What is an Activity Diagram?

An **Activity Diagram** in UML is a type of behavioral diagram that visually represents the flow of activities or actions in a system. It shows the step-by-step process, decisions, and the overall workflow.

In simple terms: "It explains how the task or process flows step by step."

It is similar to a **flowchart** and is used to model the **dynamic aspects** of a system.

## Real-Life Analogy

Think of placing an online food order:

* Open the app
* Log in
* Search for food
* Select item
* Add to cart
* Make payment
* Order placed

Each of these steps is part of an activity diagram.

## Basic Elements of an Activity Diagram

| Element  | Symbol                | Description                            |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Start    | ‚óè (filled circle)     | Where the activity begins              |
| Activity | ‚ñ° (rounded rectangle) | Represents an action or step           |
| Arrow    | ‚Üí                     | Direction of control flow              |
| Decision | ‚óá (diamond)           | Represents a decision (e.g., Yes/No)   |
| Merge    | ‚óá                     | Merges decision branches back together |
| Fork     | Thick horizontal line | Splits into parallel activities        |
| Join     | Thick horizontal line | Joins parallel activities back         |
| End      | ‚óé (bullseye circle)   | Where the activity ends                |

## Example: ATM Withdrawal Activity Diagram

```
‚óè Start
 ‚Üì
Insert ATM Card
 ‚Üì
Enter PIN
 ‚Üì
‚óá Is PIN Valid?
 |--- No ---> Show Error ‚Üí ‚óé End
 |
 ‚îî--- Yes ---> Show Options
 ‚Üì
Select Withdraw
 ‚Üì
Enter Amount
 ‚Üì
‚óá Sufficient Balance?
 |--- No ---> Show Error ‚Üí ‚óé End
 |
 ‚îî--- Yes ---> Dispense Cash
 ‚Üì
Print Receipt
 ‚Üì
‚óé End
```

## Where to Use Activity Diagrams

* To explain a **process flow** clearly
* To represent **step-by-step logic** of a use case
* To illustrate **decision points** or **parallel tasks**
* To visualize the behavior of a **functionality or service**

## Summary

| Feature      | Description                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Diagram Type | Behavioral (Flowchart-style)                    |
| Focus        | Sequence of activities / control flow           |
| Shows        | Start ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Decision ‚Üí End                |
| Use Cases    | Login flow, ATM withdrawal, Order process, etc. |
| Key Symbols  | Start (‚óè), End (‚óé), Decision (‚óá), Activity (‚ñ°)  |

An **Activity Diagram** helps in **visualizing the workflow** of a system and is extremely useful for **functional understanding** and \*\*design d

# Steps to Draw an Activity Diagram

## üß† Step 1: Choose a Use Case or Scenario

First, decide which process or flow you want to represent.

**Examples:**

* ATM Cash Withdrawal
* Ordering Food on Zomato
* Login System
* Railway Ticket Booking

### Example Use Case: "ATM Cash Withdrawal"

## üßç Step 2: Identify Major Actions / Activities

Think about the steps performed by the user or system.
Each step will become an activity box in the diagram.

**Example Actions:**

* Insert Card
* Enter PIN
* Validate PIN
* Select Withdraw
* Enter Amount
* Dispense Cash
* Print Receipt

## üéØ Step 3: Draw Start Symbol

Begin the diagram with the **Start Point (‚óè)** ‚Äî a filled black circle.

```
‚óè ‚Üê Start
```

## üîÑ Step 4: Draw Activities (Rounded Rectangles)

Use a rounded rectangle for each activity or action.

```
Insert Card
‚Üì
Enter PIN
‚Üì
Validate PIN
```

## üîÉ Step 5: Add Decision Points (‚óá)

Whenever there is a decision (Yes/No or True/False), use a **diamond symbol**.

```
‚óá Is PIN Valid?
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Show Error
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Show Options
```

## ü§ù Step 6: (Optional) Add Fork / Join for Parallel Tasks

If multiple actions happen in parallel, use a **fork** (a horizontal line) to split the flow.

```
             ‚Üì
     [Process Payment]
     ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
                   ‚Üì
       [Send Email Receipt]
```

## üõë Step 7: Add End Symbol (‚óé)

Use the **bullseye symbol (‚óé)** to indicate where the activity ends.

```
Print Receipt
‚Üì
‚óé ‚Üê End
```

## üßæ Step 8: Label Arrows Clearly

Label the arrows to clarify the transitions, especially after decisions.

```
‚óá Balance Enough?
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Show Error
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Dispense Cash
```

## üß™ Final Example Flow (Text Version)

```
‚óè Start
‚Üì
Insert Card
‚Üì
Enter PIN
‚Üì
‚óá Is PIN Valid?
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Show Error ‚Üí ‚óé
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí
    Show Options
    ‚Üì
    Select Withdraw
    ‚Üì
    Enter Amount
    ‚Üì
    ‚óá Sufficient Balance?
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Show Error ‚Üí ‚óé
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Dispense Cash
                   ‚Üì
                Print Receipt
                   ‚Üì
                 ‚óé End
```

## üß† Tools to Draw:

* üñä Pen + Paper (simplest and fastest)
* üß± Draw\.io
* üìê Lucidchart
* üìú PlantUML (code-based diagramming)

## üéØ Recap Summary:

| Step | Action                      |
| ---- | --------------------------- |
| 1    | Choose a scenario           |
| 2    | List major activities       |

# What Makes a Good Quality Code?

## ‚úÖ 1. Readability

Code should be easy to read and understand at a glance. It should feel like reading a story, not a puzzle.

**Bad:**

```java
int x = 5;
```

**Good:**

```java
int maxRetryCount = 5;
```

## ‚úÖ 2. Proper Naming Convention

Variables, functions, and class names should be meaningful and self-explanatory.

**Example:**

```java
String studentName = getStudentName();
```

## ‚úÖ 3. Well-Structured & Modular

Break code into small, reusable methods. Each method should perform a single task (Single Responsibility Principle).

## ‚úÖ 4. Commenting ‚Äì Only When Necessary

Avoid excessive comments. Comment only where the logic is complex or edge cases are handled.

**Example:**

```java
// Calculate total marks after applying bonus
int totalMarks = marks + bonus;
```

## ‚úÖ 5. Consistent Formatting

Use proper indentation. Maintain consistency in brace placement and spacing to keep the code clean and readable.

## ‚úÖ 6. Avoid Repetition (DRY Principle)

Don't Repeat Yourself. Extract repeated logic into separate reusable methods.

## ‚úÖ 7. Proper Error Handling

Handle exceptions gracefully. Show meaningful messages to the user and avoid application crashes.

**Example:**

```java
try {
   // risky code
} catch (IOException e) {
   System.out.println("File read failed: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

## ‚úÖ 8. Testable Code

Code should be easy to unit test. Avoid unnecessary side effects. Keep logic modular and isolated.

## ‚úÖ 9. Scalable & Maintainable

Design the code so that new features can be added without breaking existing functionality. It should be easy to maintain over time.

## ‚úÖ 10. Follow Industry Best Practices

Follow SOLID principles, Java naming conventions, and use design patterns where appropriate.
