# Behavioral Design Patterns (Gang of Four)

## What Are Behavioral Design Patterns?

Behavioral design patterns are used to define **how objects interact with each other**, how responsibilities are distributed among them, and how the **flow of behavior** is managed in the system.

These patterns help achieve:

* **Loose coupling** between objects
* **Better communication flow**
* **Improved flexibility and maintainability**

They focus on:

* Who does what
* How requests or events are handled
* How behavior flows through the system

## List of Behavioral Design Patterns (with Real-World Style Explanation)

| Pattern Name                | Bhai-Style Explanation                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strategy**                | When the algorithm is interchangeable — like choosing Paytm, UPI, or Cash at checkout  |
| **Observer**                | When one change updates many others — like YouTube notifications after you subscribe   |
| **Command**                 | When you turn a request into an object — like RemoteControl with undo/redo buttons     |
| **Iterator**                | When you need to go through items one by one — like using `next()` and `hasNext()`     |
| **Mediator**                | When multiple objects talk via one middleman — like Air Traffic Control                |
| **Memento**                 | When you need to save/restore object state — like Undo in MS Word                      |
| **State**                   | When object behavior depends on internal state — like Fan speed (Low/Med/High)         |
| **Template Method**         | When structure is fixed but steps are flexible — like making Tea or Coffee             |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | When a request goes through multiple handlers — like Customer Care IVR                 |
| **Visitor**                 | When you want to add operations without changing classes — like Tax visiting Employees |
| **Interpreter**             | When you need to parse or interpret a language — like Regex or SQL parser              |

## Summary

Behavioral Design Patterns are all about:

* Structuring **how objects communicate**
* Assigning **responsibility clearly**
* Keeping **interaction loosely coupled**

They help create software where:

* Behavior is more flexible
* Code is easier to maintain
* Communication is clean and well-managed
