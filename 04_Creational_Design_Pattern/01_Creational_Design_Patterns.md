# Creational Design Patterns

## What are Creational Design Patterns?

So basically, creational design patterns are all about how we create objects in our code. Instead of using `new` keyword all over the place, we use these patterns to make object creation smarter and more organized.

These patterns help us keep our code neat, reusable, and easy to manage. They also make sure our classes don't depend too much on each other, which is a good thing.

## Patterns I'm learning / learned

Here's a list of the creational design patterns I studied:

| Pattern Name             | Completed? |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Factory Method Pattern   | ✅ Yes      |
| Abstract Factory Pattern | ✅ Yes      |
| Builder Pattern          | ✅ Yes      |
| Singleton Pattern        | ✅ Yes      |
| Prototype Pattern        | ✅ Yes      |

All these five patterns come under the **Creational Design Patterns** category.

Each one helps in creating objects but in a slightly different way. Like, Singleton is used when we want only one object ever, Builder is for when we want to build an object step by step, Prototype helps us copy objects easily, and so on.

## Quick Summary:

Creational patterns help us figure out the best way to create objects in our programs. We don’t write object creation code everywhere, we just use these patterns and it keeps the code clean and less dependent.
