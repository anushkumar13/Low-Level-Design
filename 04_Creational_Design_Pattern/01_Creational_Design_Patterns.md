# Creational Design Patterns

## 🔧 What are Creational Design Patterns?

Creational Design Patterns are design patterns that focus on **how objects are created** in a flexible and reusable way. Rather than instantiating objects directly using the `new` keyword everywhere, creational patterns provide **controlled, centralized, and scalable ways** to create objects.

These patterns help manage object creation while promoting **loose coupling**, **code reusability**, and **better maintainability**.

## 🧱 Patterns You will be studying

Below is a list of creational design patterns you will study:

| Pattern Name             | Completed? |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Factory Method Pattern   | ✅ Yes      |
| Abstract Factory Pattern | ✅ Yes      |
| Builder Pattern          | ✅ Yes      |
| Singleton Pattern        | ✅ Yes      |
| Prototype Pattern        | ✅ Yes      |

➡️ These five patterns are part of the **Creational Design Patterns** family.

Each one solves the object creation problem in a different way, based on different scenarios and requirements.


## 🎯 One Line Summary:

**Creational Design Patterns** = Patterns that determine *"how and in what form an object should be created"*, without exposing the object creation logic to the client and without causing tight coupling in the system.
