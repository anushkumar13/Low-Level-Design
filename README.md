# Low-Level Design (LLD) Learning Journey

Welcome to my Low-Level Design (LLD) learning journey! This document tracks my step-by-step progress as I explore core OOP principles, design patterns, system modeling, and best practices used in software design.

## Goal

To build a strong foundation in Low-Level Design and become confident in designing scalable, maintainable, and object-oriented software systems, preparing for SDE interviews and real-world development.
