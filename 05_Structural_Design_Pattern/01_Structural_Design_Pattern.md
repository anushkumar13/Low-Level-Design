# Structural Design Patterns

## What I Understood About Structural Design Patterns

So structural design patterns are mainly about how we arrange and connect different classes or objects together in a program. Their main focus is on combining small parts to build a bigger system in a proper way. This helps in keeping the system more flexible, maintainable, and also scalable when it grows.

They are not about how to make objects (that is creational), but about how to organize them so they can work nicely together.

### LEGO Block Example That Helped Me Understand

Imagine LEGO blocks. Each block is like an object or class in our code. Structural design patterns are like the techniques or ways we follow to connect these blocks and make a big LEGO structure. We don’t change the blocks, we only decide how to attach them smartly.

## Common Structural Patterns That I Noted

| Pattern Name | What It Means in Simple Words                                                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adapter      | Helps two things to work together when they are not compatible (like a charger with a different plug) |
| Bridge       | Keeps abstraction and implementation separate so both can be changed easily                           |
| Composite    | Lets us treat a group of objects like a single object (like folder in folders)                        |
| Decorator    | Adds new features to objects without touching the original code                                       |
| Facade       | Gives a simple interface to a complicated system (like remote for TV)                                 |
| Flyweight    | Reuses objects when many of them are same to save memory                                              |
| Proxy        | A middle object that represents another object (like ATM card instead of going to bank)               |

## Why These Patterns Are Useful (as per my understanding)

* Help organize how different classes/objects are connected
* Let us reuse and extend code without changing existing code
* Make our software design cleaner and easier to manage
* Super helpful when working with large codebases

---

## One-Line Summary That Helped Me Remember

* Creational patterns → How objects are created
* Structural patterns → How objects are connected
* Behavioral patterns → How objects communicate and act

This is how I understood structural design patterns till now. They are really helpful in writing cleaner and well-structured code, especially in big projects. Will keep improving my notes as I go deeper into each pattern.
