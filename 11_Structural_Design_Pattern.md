# 🔨 Structural Design Patterns

## What Are Structural Design Patterns?

Structural design patterns focus on the **composition of classes or objects**. Their goal is to form **larger structures efficiently** while ensuring the system remains **flexible, maintainable, and scalable**.

They define **how classes and objects interact**, how they are **composed**, and how they work together to provide **new functionality**.

### 🧱 Real-Life Analogy: LEGO Blocks

Each LEGO block = one object.
Structural design patterns = the **rules or techniques** used to combine these blocks into a **large structure** — without changing the individual blocks themselves.

## 🛠️ List of Common Structural Patterns

| Pattern Name  | Description (in simple terms)                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adapter**   | Makes one object compatible with another system (like a charger adapter 🔌).                |
| **Bridge**    | Separates abstraction from implementation so both can evolve independently.                 |
| **Composite** | Combines objects in a tree-like structure (like folders inside folders).                    |
| **Decorator** | Adds new functionality to an object at runtime without altering the original code.          |
| **Facade**    | Provides a simplified interface to a complex system (like a remote control 🛏️).            |
| **Flyweight** | Shares common objects to save memory when dealing with lots of similar objects.             |
| **Proxy**     | Acts as a substitute or representative for another object (like an ATM card for your bank). |

## 🔧 Purpose of Structural Patterns

* Organize object relationships and structures
* Enable **code reuse** without modifying original classes
* Provide **flexibility and extensibility** to the software design
* Make it easier to **scale and maintain** large codebases

## 🏛 One-Liner Cement for Your Brain:

* **Creational patterns** = "How do you create objects?"
* **Structural patterns** = "How do you structure and connect objects?"
* **Behavioral patterns** = "How do objects communicate and behave together?"

Now you're ready to tackle any structural pattern like a boss! 🚀
